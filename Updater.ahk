; Updater.ahk - checks GitHub for a newer Wiz-Maxxing release and, if you say so, installs it. AHK v1.1,
; functions only; #Included by Wiz-Maxxing.ahk (it checks every time you open the bot) and Setup.ahk (which
; stores the token). The tray menu's "Check for updates" runs Wiz-Maxxing.exe /check.
;
; The repo is private, so it reads it with a GitHub token (fine-grained, read-only Contents on the repo),
; kept in Windows Credential Manager as "Wiz-Maxxing GitHub" - never in a file, never in the log.
; This folder's version is version.txt (e.g. v0.10; none = older than any release). Releases are numbered
; v0.01, v0.02, ... v0.99, v1.00, v1.01.
;
; Updating: the release zip is downloaded, the bot is closed if it's running, and the zip's files are
; copied over this folder - except your own: PlayerStats.txt (only settings it doesn't have yet are added),
; learned cards (learned\ folders, and the slot pictures learned\cards.txt says they went into), dungeon runs, potion
; routes, the walker's memory, window positions, logs. A program that's in use (Wiz-Maxxing.exe, Setup.exe)
; is renamed out of the way and the new one put in its place. It's all or nothing: every file it replaces
; is copied aside first, and if any file can't be written the folder is put back as it was, version.txt
; and all. Only then is version.txt set to the release's tag. Log: updater.log.
;
; (v2 port: ported by hand from the v1.1 original - the converter couldn't. The v1 behaviours it keeps are
; V1Compat.ahk's: ErrorLevel set by V1Do / V1RunWait as v1's commands set it, reads that v2 throws on give v1's blank)
