#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0
; Wiz-Maxxing.ahk - opens the bot: first checks GitHub for a newer version (Updater.ahk) and asks to install it,
; then starts AutoFarmer\Autofarmer.exe (else AutoFarmer\Autofarmer.ahk, with AutoHotkey). Built to
; Wiz-Maxxing.exe by build.ps1, with the wizard icon; Setup puts it in the Start menu and on the desktop.
;   Wiz-Maxxing.exe /check   only the update check, with a message either way (the tray menu's "Check for
;                            updates", the dashboard's Updates button); the bot is started again only if it was
;                            updated - /check /off or /check /standby: started again as it was (off, in standby);
;                            /playforme /nowalk /noreconnect /learnall: Play for me still on, walking or
;                            auto-reconnect still off, Learn every card still on
;   Wiz-Maxxing.exe /check /auto   the same with no question and no window (the bot - Settings: autoupdate): a newer
;                            one downloaded, the bot closes itself for it at a safe point, installed (Updater.ahk
;                            UpAuto) and the bot started again as it was then
;   Wiz-Maxxing.exe /watch   the watcher ("Open with Wizard101" - started with Windows): opens the bot in standby
;                            when Wizard101 starts (Watch.ahk); F6 then starts it
;   Wiz-Maxxing.exe /latest  only looks up the latest release, into updater.ini (the dashboard's Updates button and
;                            STATISTICS say from it whether a newer one is out) - nothing shown, nothing installed
;   Wiz-Maxxing.exe /report <file>   posts a bug report as an issue on GitHub (the dashboard's Report a bug -
;                            Updater.ahk UpReport); its answer in <file>.result
; AutoHotkey v2 (ported from v1.1).
