#Warn Unreachable, Off
; Dungeons.ahk - dungeon farming: a run you record once, walked again and again (the dashboard's Dungeons tab).
; AutoHotkey v2 (ported from v1.1), functions and labels; #Included by Autofarmer.ahk. Needs the vision helper and the
; game's memory (read-only: where the wizard is, which zone) - the same as walking by the map.
;
; Recording (Record a run): stand where the run starts - outside the dungeon, by its sigil - and play one run the
; way the bot should: X at the sigil, walk to the boss (fighting on the way), and walk back out to where you started.
; Then F9 (or Stop recording). Every 200 game units walked is a spot to walk to; each X you press is "press X here"
; (a sigil, a door, someone to talk to); a battle's start is "a battle here" (on the way back it waits a moment
; for one there); a loading screen starts the next zone's spots. Walking (F8) is off while you record. Saved as
; dungeons\<name>.txt - one step a line: kind|zone|x|y|z (walk, x, fight) - kept by updates.
;
; Running (pick one, Run): the bot walks from spot to spot by the zone's map (the route planner, round walls),
; presses X where you did, lets every battle be fought (the battle loop - the bot on, F6), Spaces through a
; dialogue, and at the end starts over - so many times (0: till you stop it). A loading screen into a zone further
; on: it carries on from there. Walking off (F8), you playing, a battle: it waits. Somewhere the recording doesn't
; go (another zone), stuck for good, or the game's memory unreadable: it stops and says why (debug.log "Dungeons: ...",
; the Dungeons tab, Discord). A defeat or a potion run that leaves the wizard in an earlier zone of the run (v0.9.0): on
; from the nearest step of that zone's first visit, 3 times a run at most - never on to its later visit on the way back out.
;
; Between runs (v0.9.0, TODO goal 5): a run that ends back where it starts is "between runs" from its end to its first X
; (or another zone) - its drops looked at and the gear pass (Gear.ahk - Settings: gearswap, a rehearsal: the plan logged,
; nothing equipped), and a full backpack quick sold there (QuickSell.ahk - quicksell on; the dungeon's hold still holds it
; - with the gear pass on, its Deck and Pet groups only - unless "...even with a dungeon's drops in it" is ticked). "Until its
; gear is swapped" (the tab's box - untilgear| in the run's file): once every slot it drops (slots|, else
; resources\dungeons_known.txt's) is worn with its own drop, or stopafter| runs (30) brought no upgrade, it goes on to its
; "then" run (next|) when that starts where the wizard stands - else it stops and says where to take the wizard
; (Discord). A boss's own deck: boss|<name>|<deck id> lines (Decks.ahk DeckPick). Older versions skip these lines.
; python vision\dglint.py checks a run's file.

;The run being walked: {name, file, steps [{kind, zone, x, y, z}], i (the step walked to), runs (done), want (0
;till stopped), the step's progress (best, bestLeft, bestAt, unstuck), fightUntil / fightBattles (waiting at a
;battle spot), loadUntil (waiting for a loading screen out of zone fromZone), push (a spot past a doorway to walk at
;meanwhile), misses, seen (battles at the last look); v0.9.0: between (1 a run just done back at its start - the pass
;due, 2 done, "" in the run), resumes (back in an earlier zone this run), slots, stopafter, next, untilgear, bosses
;([{name, deck}]), gearSaid, gearMarked (1 the backpack noted at this run's start - Gear.ahk GearRunMark / GearRunEnd)} - ""
