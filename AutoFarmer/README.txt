One script for battles and walking:
Autofarmer.ahk now does both and starts by itself when you double-click it:
it fights whenever a battle round is up (the Pass button shows) and otherwise
walks your wizard towards the quest goal by following the yellow quest arrow
(the walking comes from ..\AutoQuester\Walker.ahk). Keys:
	F6           the bot on / off (off: no battles, walking, potions or
	             reconnecting - it waits; while it's off, F6 and F8 only work
	             in Wizard101, and the Alt+ keys aren't taken at all)
	F8           walking on / off
	Windows+1    restart (Alt+Esc too)
	Windows+Esc  quit
These are the keys out of the box - change any of them on the dashboard's Keys
tab (below); the messages then name your keys.
It only presses movement keys while Wizard101 is the active window. Don't run
AutoQuester.ahk at the same time.

Discord alerts (tray menu "Discord alerts..."): when the wizard needs you, a
message goes to your Discord channel - stuck (walking stopped), a teleport that
doesn't work, no quest arrow, waiting at the quest goal, a collect quest that
needs you, out of potions with none to be had, "Crowns" seen in a potion run
or a quick sell, out of mana, a wizard it doesn't know, the backpack full and
not quick sold, the gold bag nearly full, or it can't get back
into the game (a login turned down, patching, the launcher). It says what's
wrong, the zone and the time - never a login or a screenshot. Set it up: in
Discord the channel's settings > Integrations > Webhooks > New Webhook > Copy
Webhook URL, then paste it into "Discord alerts..." (typed hidden; kept in
Windows Credential Manager as "Wiz-Maxxing Discord webhook", never in a file
or debug.log) - a test message is sent. Empty: another test; OFF: removed.
The same alert at most once in 10 minutes; alertson:0 (the Settings window)
switches them off. debug.log: "Discord: ...".

The log on OneDrive (Settings: "Copy the log to OneDrive", logmirror:1): debug.log
is also written to your OneDrive folder, Wiz-Maxxing logs\<this PC's name>\,
with a picture of the game every 2 minutes and at each alert (snap_*.jpg, the
newest 15) - OneDrive syncs it, so the bot on one PC can be followed from
another. Off by default; nothing else is sent anywhere.

Dungeon farming (the dashboard's Dungeons tab): record a run once - stand
outside the dungeon by its sigil, click "Record a run" and play it (X at the
sigil, to the boss, fighting on the way, back out to where you started), then
press F9 and name it. Pick it and click Run (so many times, or 0 = until you
stop it): the bot walks the same way by the zone's map, presses X where you
did, fights every battle (the bot on, F6), Spaces through dialogues and starts
over. F8 pauses it. Somewhere the run doesn't go (a potion run, a defeat), or
stuck for good: it stops and says why (the tab, debug.log "Dungeons: ...",
Discord). Runs are kept in dungeons\<name>.txt (updates keep them). Needs the
vision helper and the game's memory, like walking by the map.

Open with Wizard101 (tray menu, or Setup.exe): a small watcher starts with
Windows (a shortcut in your Startup folder to Wiz-Maxxing.exe /watch - its
own tray icon) and opens the bot by itself when Wizard101 starts - in
standby: it does nothing till you press F6 in the game. Before that it checks
for updates (it asks only if there's a newer release). Never a second bot: one
already running is left alone. A bot opened this way and never turned on
closes when the game does, and opens again with it. The tray menu's tick (or
the watcher's own "Don't open with Wizard101 any more") turns it off.

Walking by the game's memory (navmem:1 in PlayerStats.txt, the default): the
vision helper also reads where the wizard is, which way it faces and where the
quest arrow points straight out of the game's memory - READ-ONLY: nothing in
the game is written or changed, and it sends no keys of its own. The walker
steers by it once it's checked (it agrees with the arrow on screen, or a turn
goes the way it says), uses its distance instead of the OCR'd number, walks on
by it when the arrow can't be seen (scenery, or Pigswick Academy's gold carpet,
which the see-through arrow can't be picked out from) and measures its turns.
It also follows a route the helper plans round the walls over the zone's map
(the Map window draws it in green), instead of walking into them. Whenever it can't be used it follows the arrow on screen as before
(debug.log: "the game's memory ..."). navmem:0 = only the arrow on screen.
More in ..\AutoQuester\README.txt.

Smoother walking: steering by the game's memory on its route, a big turn (up to
100 degrees) is made walking on when the helper says the wizard's turning arc
there is clear of walls and mobs (its turning circle is worked out from how
fast it walks); else, and by the bare arrow, it stops and turns on the spot as
before. It arrives on one memory reading, or when it has walked right past the
goal, instead of going to and fro over it. The speed stays as it is through its
own short stops (a mob or the party waited for), dropping to 1x once it has
stood 1.5 s, and goes fast only once W has been held a moment - no 1x/2x flips.
Talking, X, dialogues, sigils, gates, battles, you playing, F8 and exit are 1x
at once, as ever.
Near the goal by the game's memory (the goal in this zone, 1500 game units or
less, straight ahead, no mob on the way): the last bit is walked closed loop -
W up, 1x (from 2500 off; a zone's way out from 600), turned on the spot to
face the goal, then W held
while its place is read every ~40 ms and let go at it: a talk goal's NPC 300
off, anything else 150. Then X. It no longer walks over the goal and turns
round. A fence, wall or water between (the way round much longer than
straight): no straight walk - it goes round by the route. A goal on another
floor is never "walked past". A talk goal ("Talk To ..."): a prompt is the quest's only with its NPC's
name on it (no X at a vendor next to it); its prompt is X'd even just after a
dialogue (3 s after the last X, 3 tries in 2 minutes); the talk is done when
the game's goal changes, not by the arrow's number (it jumps by the goal); X
that opens nothing is tried again from close by - never walked on through the
NPC; a shop it opened is closed - and after 3 tries it waits by it (a notice, once) and tries again every
2 minutes. Its distance is always used (the arrow's 1 = 100 game units when
the scale isn't sure), learned only with the goal in the zone; no back-up for
a hidden arrow while it steers. debug.log: "Walk: approach: ...", and every X
says where the goal is ("the game's memory: the goal N units off").
Turning with the mouse (mousesteer:1 - Settings, on unless you switch it off):
walking, the wizard is turned with the mouse - the right button held in the
middle of the scene and the mouse slid, then let go - at once, so it doesn't
stop at corners; the mouse goes back where it was. Only while it walks by the
game's memory (it reads the facing back as it turns - how far a mouse count
turns the wizard is measured on the first turn), out of battle, Wizard101 in
front, you away from the keyboard and mouse 3 s, at 5x or less, no window
over the middle of the game (its words: Crowns, shop, quest...). You touching
the keyboard or mouse mid-turn ends it there, the mouse left to you. Anything
not sure, and every turn on the spot: A/D as before. Not in the first 0.6 s
after setting off (the right button turns the wizard while he runs). The mouse
not turning the wizard three times: left alone for 10 minutes. debug.log:
"mouse steering: ..." (when it doesn't turn him: where the cursor was before
and after the slide, and whether it showed). Once a minute after walking, debug.log says how smooth it was: "Walk: the
last minute: W held N% of N s out walking, N stops, N turns on the spot, N
turns walking on (N by the mouse), N speed keys".

Faster walking with Cheat Engine's speedhack (Settings: "Walk faster with
Cheat Engine's speedhack", off unless you switch it on): Cheat Engine - yours,
installed and attached to Wizard101 by you - speeds the game up; the bot only
presses its speedhack hotkeys (F13-F24, keys no keyboard has): the walking key
while it walks, the 1x key for battles (pressed at every round), talking,
dialogues, shops, near the goal, collecting, dungeon runs, a teleport ahead,
getting round an obstacle, when you play, F6 and when it stops. Its turn and
wait times are divided by the speed; above 5x turns are made at 1x. In Cheat
Engine: Settings > Hotkeys, two "Speedhack speed" entries - the walking speed
(speedfactor) and 1 - with "Disable when released" unticked; the tray menu's
"Speedhack: press its ... key in 3 s" items press a key while you're in its
hotkey box. If the wizard doesn't turn faster (Cheat Engine not attached after
Wizard101 restarts, the key not taking) the bot stops using it for the run
("speed: off for this run" in debug.log). Risky: KingsIsle may notice.
Mobs (mobavoid:1, the default - Settings: "Keep away from mobs"): the helper
also reads the zone's mobs out of the game's memory (read-only) and the route
keeps out of what each one sees, so no battle starts on the way: Settings,
"...what they see" (mobshape) - a semi-circle in front (the default), a
circle all round, or a cone in front (mobcone degrees wide) - mobradius (300)
far; which way each faces is read from the game too, and a little room is
kept all round its body. Players put the cone at 50 to 120 degrees; to
measure what they really see, each
battle's first round logs which mob started it, how far away you were and how
many degrees off its facing ("Caught by ..." in debug.log). Not
the mobs the quest is about: those named in its goal line ("Defeat 3 Lost
Souls"), or standing at its goal; and not while collecting. With no way round
(a narrow street), the wizard stands still till the mob moves off - 25 s at
most, then it walks on past it. Never inside one's reach or sight, though (a
mob walked up, or the wizard came out of a battle there): it walks out of it
first - along the route if that leads out, else the shortest way out (never
nearer the mob) on the quest's side - backing straight out when the way out is
behind, never standing still turning in it - and only then waits. A battle
starting (the wizard held or turned by the game) no longer stops it steering
by the game's memory; while it doesn't, it keeps to the route by the arrow, and
with no route at all it won't walk the arrow's straight way into a mob's reach
(20 s at most) or back up into one. The walk to the potion seller keeps away from
all of them. The dashboard's Map shows them: red dots with a faint ring (kept
away from: its shape), the quest's amber, the nearest ones named.

Mobs that catch you anyway (mobgrow:1): each battle a mob the quest doesn't
need starts (not collecting, not one named in the goal line, not right after X
at the goal, not a dungeon run that fights everything, not while you play)
widens the reach the route keeps out of - to where it caught you from, and 25
more (20 at the least; 1500 at most): how far they notice you (mobradius) when
it caught you in front of it, their reach all round (mobbody - a semi-circle or
cone's sides and back, 120 at first) when from the side or behind. debug.log
says so under "Caught by ..."; set them back in Settings any time.

Bring Wizard101 to the front (gamefront:0 - the dashboard's "Game to front"
button, the tray menu, Settings): with Wizard101 not the window in front, the
bot brings it there when the quest arrow shows (walking - once you've left the
keyboard and mouse alone 3 s, so what you type elsewhere doesn't end up in the
game) or a battle round is up. It brings the window forward; it never clicks in
it to do so. Left the PC with another window in front (nothing touched for 5
minutes): the game's brought forward all the same, setting or not - and after a
reconnect it's left in front - else the bot can't walk and the game logs out
for inactivity.

You playing: while you use the keyboard or mouse yourself, the bot waits - no
battle rounds, no walking, no potions; a walking key it held is let go at once.
It carries on 3 s after you stop (handsoff in PlayerStats.txt; 0 = it never
waits). If you take over during its turn, it leaves that round to you.
Switch it on/off with the tray menu "Wait while I play" (ticked = on) or the
dashboard's "Wait for me" button; it's kept in PlayerStats.txt (handsoffon).
It's on again, with 3 s, every time the bot starts - it never takes the mouse
from you as it starts; switched off or changed, that holds for the run.

Play for me (the dashboard's red button, or the tray menu): for leaving the
PC for days. Every check for you is off - it no longer waits while you use the
keyboard or mouse, gives the mouse back, keeps out of a window you're using or
leaves a shop's window to you; it brings Wizard101 to the front whenever it
needs it. It asks you to type pimpmeout to turn it on (your say-so); a click
turns it off. It's off at every start - the bot only takes control once you've
said so. F6 and F8 still stop it.

Updates: opening Wiz-Maxxing (Start menu, desktop, ..\Wiz-Maxxing.exe) checks
GitHub for a newer release and asks before installing it; tray menu "Check for
updates" does it any time - so does the dashboard's Updates button (top right),
which says live whether a newer version is out ("Update to v..."; it looks it up
45 s after the bot starts and every autoupdate minutes, out of the bot's way). The version
is in the windows' titles, the tray menu's first line and the dashboard's
STATISTICS. Needs a GitHub token once per PC (Setup.exe, "GitHub updates").
Your settings, learned cards, potion routes and pictures are kept.
updater.log (next to Wiz-Maxxing.exe) says what it did.
Collect quest items by the game's memory (Settings > WALKING, collectmem - on):
a "Collect N <things>" goal whose things lie about the zone (Piece Of Coral in
The Grotto, from the game's item names) - each one's place is read from the
game's memory (read-only), the nearest walked to round walls and mobs and
stepped onto (picked up; still there after a moment: X), then the next. One it
can't reach in a minute waits 3 minutes. None seen: it roams and walks into
monsters as before. A collect goal the game shows no arrow for (its goal has
no place) is read where its line sits and collected the same way. The
dashboard's map shows them as green diamonds (the goal's brighter, named).
debug.log: "Walk: collect: ...".
Goals the game shows no way to ("Use Inactive Protector in District of the
Stars (0 of 3)" stood there doing nothing): the game's memory (navmem:1,
read-only) says when the quest helper has no place for the goal - the arrow
seen on screen then is a phantom: not followed, no X at nothing, no pushing on,
no waiting there - and what kind of goal it is. A goal to use things (Use,
Read, a "Collect" of an object): its things are found in the game's memory and
in the zone's own file - all of them, even far off - the nearest walked to
round walls and mobs (mobs kept off, no monsters walked into), X at the prompt
naming it, the count watched: up, the next; not, X once more, then it's left
for 5 minutes. One that shows no prompt: one X in case, then left. None known:
it looks about, X only at a prompt naming the thing (never a teleporter), and
after 3 minutes shows a notice (Quest needs you); each one tried and the count
not rising: the notice at once. A go-to goal: the place by its name (a thing,
or one of the zone's volumes) walked to, no X; the same goal 5 s there: walked
through it, then the notice. A talk goal: the NPC by its name walked to, then
talked to as any talk goal (its own prompt, 3 tries, the wait by it). Anything
else ("Practice Photomancy"): left alone, nothing roamed for. Waiting at a goal:
its id and count are read every 3 s - moved on, it walks on at once. A use
goal's prompts on the way: X only at the ones naming its thing; collecting
never X's a teleporter's. An older helper (no "no place"): as before.
debug.log: "Walk: use: ...", "Walk: go: ...", "Walk: talk: ...".
Mobs kept off: a catch by a mob the quest doesn't need raises how far they're
kept off (mobgrow); every 10 minutes of walking without one it's made a tenth
smaller again - never below what you set yourself in Settings (mobshrink).
A collect goal keeps them off too (all but the mobs its goal line names).
The quest's goal line from the game's memory (navmem:1, read-only - the
helper's /goal, vision\questmem.py): the line under the quest arrow ("Defeat
Gobblers in Colossus Boulevard (0 of 4)") is read exactly as the game draws
it, with what it names - the mob or its kind, the item, the NPC - its kind
(defeat, collect, go to, talk to) and its count, instead of by OCR of the
screen, which slips letters ("Opiio (jn -rhe" for "Defeat Optio Agenor ...":
the quest's own mob was kept away from). Which mobs are the quest's (walked
into, not kept off), the quest items picked up, collecting and its count all
go by it; a mob whose name only shares a word with the place (Grotto Crab in
"... in The Grotto") is no longer taken for the quest's. When it can't be
read (navmem:0, an older helper, no quest) or the game hides the line (the
quest helper off), the line is OCR'd as before. The memory keeps the line
whatever is drawn over it, so collecting a goal with no arrow starts only
while the line shows on screen too (not over a dialogue or a window X
opened, nor a screen Remote Desktop doesn't draw), and never while X was
just pressed or the wizard's talking. A mob the helper took for the quest's
(its name, its kind - "Gobblers" for a Gobbler Scavenger - or one by a
fight goal) that catches the wizard doesn't make the mobs' reach bigger
(mobgrow). In a game build the helper doesn't know yet, the look for the
quest's data runs on its own, further apart while it finds nothing - the
card and position reads don't wait for it.
debug.log: "Walk: the quest's goal line: ... (from the game)" - "(from the
screen)" when OCR'd; vision\vision.log: "goal (memory): ...".
Turning: by the mouse - any turn while the wizard runs, backing up (turned
round, walked off, turned back - not the S key), getting out of a mob's reach,
walking to a quest item, following the party's leader, a dungeon run, close by
its target too - and from standing (the camera turned with the right button,
then W: he faces the camera's way). The keys (A/D, S) only when the mouse fails
(two misses from standing: not tried that way for 10 minutes - debug.log
"mouse steering: ...").
Decks (the dashboard's Cards tab - its row of buttons: Hand & enemies, your
decks, + Deck): a "Small deck" (collect goals and anything else) and a "Large
deck" (bosses) to start with, more with + Deck or Copy (6 at most). Each has:
its school (or any), what it's used for (anything else, collect goals, bosses -
see below, dungeon runs, farming - loop/lore mode), a priority (of
two for the same, the higher), the game's Equipment Set that puts its in-game
deck on (Ctrl+1-9: set the sets up in the game - they swap gear, pet and mount
too; pressed out of battle with you away, once a minute at most), and the
settings it has of its own (pick one in its list, type the value, Set - empty:
your Settings'): card logic, blades, traps, aura, bubble, healing, pips,
discards, which of hit1-4 and the heals it plays. Its damage a hit as a range:
its weakest hit with nothing on it to its strongest at its best roll with every
boost it plays and a critical (x2 - its most, against no block; with your
damage % and critical for that school - the community's crit model, KingsIsle
doesn't publish one). Save keeps it (decks\<name>.txt - updates keep them);
"pinned" uses it whatever's ahead. Before each fight the bot picks one - the
dungeon run's (its Deck box on the Dungeons tab), a pinned one, the boss's,
collect's, farming's, anything else's - and logs "Deck: <name> (why)" (the
dashboard's Deck line shows it too). No deck set up, or one that sets
nothing: it plays exactly as without.
Bosses before the fight, by the game's memory (navmem:1, read-only - vision\
bossmem.py, the helper's /mobs and /battle): each of the zone's mobs' title as
the game has it (Boss, Elite, Normal...), rank, max health and the game's own
boss flag. Out of battle, the bot on and nothing loading, a boss is "ahead"
when the quest's goal names it, the walker goes to it (the quest's mob by its
name or by its goal - not one of the same family elsewhere in the zone) or the
dungeon run's way leads to it - an Elite only when it takes 3 or more of your
best hits (its max health against the deck's strongest hit at its best, no
critical). One only passed by isn't (the walker routes round it; one walked
into is found in the battle). The deck for bosses is picked then and its
Equipment Set pressed before the fight (10 s after the last press, not the
minute) - "Deck: Large deck (a boss ahead: Governor Nereus, rank 9 boss)".
Kept till that battle's over, or 30 s after the boss is gone or far off (from
the end of a battle it wasn't in); a missed reading changes nothing (no
switching back and forth), but 2 minutes of them, the bot off or another zone
let it go. A set pressed just before a battle starts is pressed again after
it. In the battle its enemies are read from the memory: a boss among them gets
the boss deck's settings without Alt+1 ("a boss in this battle: ..."; not
read: the boss ahead it was walked into); a fight on the way to the boss keeps
the boss deck's settings while its Equipment Set is the one on ("(its deck is
on)"). Alt+1 works as before. No memory (navmem:0, no helper, dual mode):
Alt+1 only.
The Network tab (Settings > NETWORK - off till you switch it on, on each PC):
every bot on your home network - its PC, version, wizard, zone, on/off, Play
for me, what it's doing, health, mana, deaths. Pick one: its last 80 log lines
and a picture of its game (only while Wizard101 is the window in front there -
nothing else on its screen is sent), every 6 s. Its buttons turn that bot on
or off, switch its Play for me off, or restart it - only between bots with the
same network PIN (netpin, not 0); Play for me can't be switched on from the
network (pimpmeout at that PC). Windows asks once on each PC to let Python
through its firewall: allow it on Private networks. Both PCs' clocks have to
be right (2 minutes apart at most). debug.log: "Network: ...".
Updating by itself (Settings > UPDATES, autoupdate - on, every 10 minutes): the
bot looks for a newer release every that many minutes and downloads it while
it plays on; then it closes itself for it - never closed under it - once it's
out of battle, nothing's loading or logging in, no dungeon run or recording is
under way and you've left the keyboard and mouse alone a minute (Play for me:
no wait), and it's installed with no question and no window. The bot starts
again as it was: on, off or in standby, Play for me, walking (F8),
auto-reconnect and Learn every card as they were (not if you closed it
meanwhile). A version that won't install (a file in use) is put back and tried
3 times, then left to the Updates button. 0 = only when you click.
debug.log: "Updates: ..."; updater.log: "auto: ...".

Party (Settings > PARTY; tray menu Party...): up to 4 wizards, one per PC on the
same home network. One is the Leader - it quests as now, and stops while a
follower is far (partywaitdist), in another zone, loading or not ready, for
partywaitmax s at most. The others are Followers - instead of their own quest
they walk to the leader (stopping partynear from it), into its battles (where
it stood when the battle started), and through the door it took (its last spot
in the zone, then on the way it was going). Set each wizard's party name, and on
each follower the leader PC's name or IP, with Party... (kept in party.ini). The
leader's PC asks once to let Python through Windows' firewall - allow it on
Private networks (the home network has to be set to Private). The bots share
where each wizard is and what it's doing, and each one's battle part, its
wizard's name, school and hits. Nothing one sends makes another press anything:
a blader's boosts go to the hitter's plate as its own screen shows it, found by
the name the game's own log gives for its side. Still to come: teleport to
friend when the leader is somewhere a door doesn't lead (the follower waits and
says so).
	- Your own plate in a party battle: found by your wizard's name (learned
	  from a battle with no other wizard on your side - the game's log; one
	  such battle first), read off the plates along the bottom.
	- Battle roles (Settings > PARTY, "...in a party battle this wizard is
	  the"): Hitter plays as now. Blader puts its blades on the party's hitter
	  (the wizard set to Hitter - the leader's first -, else the leader), its
	  traps on the enemy the hitter goes for (the least health), casts them
	  again after each of the hitter's hits (once that round's out, by the
	  game's log), Tower Shield on the hitter, and hits only for a kill or with
	  nothing else to do. Healer heals whichever of you is lowest under 'Heal
	  under this %' (its plate read like yours), shields them, else boosts as a
	  blader. Your school's own blade, trap and bubble only go on a hitter of
	  your school; a support's aura isn't cast. One school's wizard its own
	  part: <school>.partybattle:2 in PlayerStats.txt. Not sure (the party off,
	  no hitter on your side heard from in 5 s, its plate not read, dual mode):
	  it hits, as ever - debug.log says why once a battle.
	- A heal on an ally that went out without asking who: one whose learned
	  text says it heals all of you is kept as <school>.healNtarget:2 (still
	  used for an ally); one that heals only you as :0, not tried on an ally
	  again (set :2 yourself for a heal picture you cut).
	- Alt+2 on a plate (a friend's wizard without the bot): the boosts go there
	  that battle; your own cards are still looked for in your school.
	- Ice's blades and traps are elemental now (they were taken for spirit).

Report a bug (the dashboard's button, top right, or the tray menu): say what
went wrong; Send posts it as an issue on the Wiz-Maxxing repo on GitHub, with
the version, this PC's name, the screen, what the dashboard's STATISTICS and
WHAT IT SEES show and (ticked) the end of debug.log - anything that looks
secret (a Discord webhook, a GitHub token, password=...) blanked out. It uses
the updates' GitHub token, which needs Issues: Read and write as well: on
github.com, Settings > Developer settings > Fine-grained tokens > the
Wiz-Maxxing token > Edit > Repository permissions > Issues: Read and write >
Update (the same token keeps working - nothing to change on the PCs). Closing
the window keeps what you typed until it's sent.

Simple and advanced views: the dashboard's bottom-right button switches it -
simple shows what the bot is doing and seeing (STATISTICS, WHAT IT SEES) with
the main buttons, advanced adds the live log and its buttons.
The Settings window's "All settings" / "Fewer settings" switches it between the
most used settings and all of them (changes not saved yet are kept). Each is
remembered (dashboard.ini [view]); a new install starts simple, one that ran
before starts advanced.

Dashboard (Dashboard.ahk): a window with statistics (battles, deaths - this run
and all time, from the game's log: taken out of a battle without fleeing -
rounds, cards cast per card, passes, discards, kill-check hits, potions, cards
learned),
what the bot sees right now (your health/mana/pips, the hand card by card - ?
for a card it doesn't know, * for a greyed-out one - enemies' health, zone,
the walker) and the log as it's written, coloured by what each line is about
(movement blue, battle orange, waits grey, problems red, potions, reconnect,
party, alerts, the bot itself - the Colours button over the log changes them,
kept in dashboard.ini [logcolors]). Windows+2 or the tray menu shows /
hides it; it opens on a monitor the game isn't on and remembers where you put
it (dashboard.ini). It never takes the focus by itself. Its X (close) stops
the bot; minimise it (or Windows+2) to just put it away. Next to STATISTICS:
the CPU and RAM in use, every second - the bot (with its vision helper), the
game and the whole PC (CPU share of all cores, RAM in use). Its tabs: Bot (all
that), Dungeons (below), Spells (the cards it learned - see "Learned spells"
under New cards; tray menu "Learned spells" opens it there) and Cards: your
hand as the bot read it this round (each card's picture, what it took it for,
its pips - white known, yellow new to it, grey can't cast) with the Learn every
card button, and the enemies' spells (see Enemy spells) - each enemy's school,
rank and health, the chance it hits you, its pips, and under it every spell it
has, likeliest first: the chance it casts it this round, its pips and damage,
the rounds it cast it this battle, and how often it was seen casting it.

Settings (the dashboard's Settings button, or the tray menu "Settings..."):
the mouse and the bot's waits, and how it plays its cards, in one window -
point at a setting to see what it does. Save writes them to PlayerStats.txt
(each in its own line, comments kept) and the bot uses them at once - no
restart. Defaults fills in the defaults (Save to use them).
	- The mouse and waits: Wait for me (on/off, and the seconds after you
	  stop), put the mouse back (when the bot takes the mouse - a battle
	  round, a click out of battle - it goes back to where it was once it's
	  done, unless you used the mouse or keys meanwhile), mouse speed, the
	  wait before each click (plus a random bit, so clicks aren't evenly
	  timed), the wait after clicks, before playing a round, after a discard
	  and before looking at the hand again.
	- Health: heal under %, drink a potion under %, flee when out of cards.
	- The backpack: quick sell it when it's full, pets too, after a dungeon
	  too (see Quick sell below).
	- Card logic: boost first (traps - on the boss, else on the enemy with
	  the most health -, blades, bubble, aura, then
	  the biggest hit it can cast - as always), hit first (the biggest hit it
	  can cast as soon as it has one; boosts only in rounds it has none -
	  quick on weak mobs), or boost first on a boss you picked (Alt+1) and
	  hit first otherwise. Boosts before each hit (0 = all it has), the kill
	  check and its margin, which kinds of cards it plays at all (blades,
	  traps/Feint, bubble, aura, the wand's hit, Tower Shield, Reshuffle - a
	  kind switched off is discarded when "Discard cards it never plays" is
	  on), boosting again after each hit, counting traps in the kill check
	  when you fight alone, saving pips for a finishing hit, and discarding.

Smart App Control (Windows 11 - "Smart App Control blocked"): it blocks the
bot's exes (they aren't signed) and can't be told to allow them. Run the bot as
scripts instead: install AutoHotkey v1.1 from autohotkey.com (Download > v1.1),
then open ..\Wiz-Maxxing.ahk (not Wiz-Maxxing.exe) - and Setup.ahk for Setup.
Started as a script, everything the bot starts is a script too, by the same
AutoHotkey (the bot, the update check, "Open with Wizard101", Setup's
shortcuts) - never one of the exes. If the vision helper (Python) can't start
there either, cards are found the old way and walking follows the arrow on
screen; the only other way is turning Smart App Control off (Windows Security
> App & browser control - on most PCs it can't be turned back on).

Executables: ..\Wiz-Maxxing.exe starts the bot (Setup.exe puts it in the Start menu
and on the desktop). Autofarmer.exe (and StatsReader.exe here, AutoQuester.exe in
..\AutoQuester) do the same as the .ahk scripts without AutoHotkey installed.
Keep each exe in its folder - it reads the pictures, PlayerStats.txt and
vision\ from there (and AutoQuester\resources\). The vision helper still needs
Python 3 with numpy and Pillow (pip install numpy pillow katsuba - katsuba only
draws the zone's walls on the zone map; Setup.exe installs all three); without
it cards are found the old way (ImageSearch) and the walker follows the arrow on
screen. Rebuild after changing a script:
double-click ..\build.cmd (needs AutoHotkey v1.1 with its compiler; close the bot first).
Ready-built: the Releases page of the GitHub repo (a zip with everything). Hover the wizard icon in the tray to see what
the walker is doing; debug.log has the battle and walking decisions in order.

Auto-reconnect (Reconnect.ahk, on from the start):
	- Disconnected (e.g. "You have been disconnected due to inactivity." after
	  about 15 minutes idle outside battle, or "Connection Lost!"): it reads
	  the game's own log, finds RECONNECT on the box and clicks it - never
	  QUIT. That logs back in without a password and puts you back where you
	  were. It first clicks with the game left in the background; if the game
	  ignores that it brings the game to the front for a moment and gives
	  focus back. If the character select screen stays up, it clicks Play
	  (with the game brought to the front: that screen ignores background
	  clicks).
	  Failed tries wait longer each time (30 s, 1, 2, 4, then 10 minutes).
	- The game closed (a crash or Quit): it asks whether to start it again
	  (yes after 60 seconds if nobody answers), starts it, types your saved
	  login into the game's login box and goes back in. It only presses Enter
	  once it can read your username back in the login box (an OCR slip or
	  two allowed in a longer one), and stops for good if the game turns the
	  login down.
	- Stuck on a loading screen (hungload, Settings: 5 minutes, 0 = never): a
	  zone change the game's log says began that long ago, nothing but its
	  memory notes written for 3 minutes, Wizard101 in front and neither the
	  spellbook nor a battle round shown since: it asks (yes after 60 seconds
	  if nobody answers), closes Wizard101 and starts it again as above.
	  debug.log: "Reconnect: the game has been on a loading screen N minutes".
	- "Client is out of date" after maintenance: it starts the launcher so it
	  can patch (it fills in the launcher's login too - not tried yet).
	Tray menu: "Auto-reconnect on/off", and "Set Wizard101 login..." to save
	your username and password for when the game has to be started again.
	The login is kept encrypted in Windows Credential Manager as
	"Wizard101Bot" (Control Panel > Credential Manager > Windows Credentials
	to see or remove it), never in a file and never in debug.log. Without
	it, only the RECONNECT part works. debug.log lines start "Reconnect:".

Window size / UI size (any resolution):
The game draws its buttons and cards bigger or smaller depending on the
window size / resolution, the Windows display scaling and Options > UI Size,
and a picture only matches at the size it was cut at. Pictures are cut at a
few sizes:
	resources\, storm\, ...  the main set: 1920x1080 window, 100% scaling,
	                         UI Size Small (UI scale 1)
	ui1.265\                 1920x1200 window at 100% scaling (UI 1.265x):
	                         Storm and Myth cards, Pass, the spellbook, the
	                         name plate, the school icons (see its README)
At any other size the bot makes its own set (PicScale.ahk): in the first
battle round at that size it reads the Pass and Flee buttons (OCR) to measure
the UI scale, checks it by making the Pass button at sizes around that, then
resizes every picture it needs from the sharpest cut set into
generated\ui<scale>\ (debug.log: "UI size: ..." and "made ..."). That first
round takes ~10 s longer; the made set is kept, so later rounds and later
runs at that size start straight away. Seen working at 2560x1440 borderless
(UI 1.14). Made pictures are found with a little more colour tolerance and
remade by themselves when a cut picture changes; delete generated\ to make
them all again. Shrinking works best, so cut new pictures at the biggest size
you play at (a ui<scale> folder: the bot finds those by itself).
The script uses whichever set's Pass button or spellbook it can see (debug.log
says "Pictures: ..."), and sizes its search areas to match. A card with no
picture in any set just counts as not in hand (debug.log says which).

Sometimes we just need a break from all that farming in wizard101
or maybe you've been questing and are just sick of it, i have just
the solution for you. I thought I'd take some time out of my life
to create a program which basically plays the game for me. With this
program, I've been able to read so many books AND get Darkmoor gear
easily. Sound Good? You say you don't like to read? Well just endure
this much and then you'll be overpowered in Wizard101 in no time.

To begin install Autohotkey from https://www.autohotkey.com then 
open the AutoFarmer.ahk file. Once its open, you should be able to see 
it in the tab menu on the Taskbar. You can then activate the script 
by pressing the key combo "Windows+1".

Now whenever you join a battle the program will take over your
mouse and create a strategy based on the cards you have. Please
note however it only has a select few cards out of the many that 
are in Wizard101. so far it mainly uses hit all spells, blades,
traps, feints, auras, enchants, towers, and bubbles

This program prioritizes cards based on priority. The priority 
chart goes in this order, feint, trap, blade, aura, hit, tower,
reshuffle, and if no other move can be found, it'll pass. So what
this means is that if there's a blade and a tower in hand, it'll use
the blade first because it has a higher priority.

Now this program isn't smart enough to figure out where a 
boss might be(If it can't do that it can't trap, feint or convert!), 
so I've added a hotkey that allows you to manually set it, the 
key combo is Alt+1, A message box will appear instructing 
the player to click where the boss is. Please be careful where you click
if you click in the wrong spot, it'll remember it and won't work correctly.

Occasionally the program chooses a ally to blade which the player
using the program disagrees with, I've added a hotkey to 
solve this issue as well. Use the key combo Alt+2 to 
manually set the "Hammers" location. Works exactly like the 
boss location.

Saving pips (pipsave, pipsavehealth in PlayerStats.txt):
When nothing in hand ends the battle this round, but a hit that would end it
- an AoE that kills every enemy, or a hit that kills the last one - costs
more pips than you have, the bot saves up for it (up to pipsave rounds,
default 3): no other hit spends pips meanwhile (the wand's free hit, blades,
traps, healing and Pass still go), and the kill check casts it the round it's
affordable. Not while your health is under pipsavehealth % (default 50); it
gives up for the battle if the pips don't come. debug.log and the dashboard
say "saving pips for ...".

Enemy spells (enemyspells:1 - Settings, HEALTH): each round the bot works out
what each enemy will most likely cast and the chance their hits kill you this
round - in debug.log ("enemy spells: ..."), on the dashboard (Threat) and,
each enemy's every spell with its chance, on the dashboard's Cards tab.
	- Who's fighting and what each cast comes from the game's own log
	  (Bin\WizardClient.log, only read): it names every slot of the circle
	  and each caster's spell each round, passes too.
	- Each creature's spells, pips and damage come from the Wizard101 wiki on
	  Fandom (Wizard101 Central's blocks bots), looked up once and kept in
	  wiki\cache.json for a month; a creature's first battle may show
	  "looking it up". Its pips are guessed from the round (mobs pick a card
	  at random and pass if they can't afford it, so they save up).
	- Every enemy cast seen is counted for its creature (wiki\casts.json),
	  so the odds sharpen with every battle against it.
	- defendat (30): when the chance their hits kill you is that % or more
	  and no hit in hand ends the battle (the kill check goes first), a heal
	  on yourself, else Tower Shield, goes before anything else. 0 = only
	  show the odds. A hit at one target is counted at you 1 in however many
	  wizards are on your side.

Enchants (Strong, Giant, Monstrous, Gargantuan, Colossal, Epic - treasure cards
too) go on the hit about to be cast, a learned hit in no slot as well; an
enchant or a treasure card is never discarded.

Kill check:
At the start of every round the program reads each enemy's health off the
nameplates at the top of the screen and works out how much damage each hit
in your hand would do. If one of them kills every enemy it casts it right
away (the cheapest one that works - the wand's free hit first - and without
the enchant if it doesn't need it) instead of putting up more blades and
traps. A hit on one enemy (<school>.hitNtarget:1) only counts when one enemy
is left. When one is cast, it goes where it does the most - the least of its
damage and the enemy's health: a big hit isn't thrown at an enemy nearly dead
while another is at full; of those it kills, the healthiest; none, the
weakest. debug.log says after the kill check what it counts on from each hit
in hand ("your hits now: ..."). If it can't read the
health, or no hit is enough yet, it plays exactly like before.
	- Draw treasure cards for an enchant that kills (the Settings window, off
	  unless you switch it on): when no hit ends the battle but one would with
	  an enchant on it (any - Strong's +100 counted, drawneed) and there's none
	  in hand, it draws from your treasure-card deck (DRAW, between Pass and
	  Flee) till an enchant comes, then runs the kill check again. Draw is
	  greyed out with 7 cards, so one card it knows is discarded first - never
	  a treasure card, a card it doesn't know or a greyed one, the hit, an
	  enchant, or one you said never to discard. At most drawround (3) draws a
	  round, drawmax (6) a battle; Draw greyed out with room in hand (no treasure
	  cards left): not again for 30 minutes. Never with "Crown" read by the
	  buttons, nor while you play. debug.log: "draw: ...".
	- Enchants: Epic, Colossal, Gargantuan, Monstrous, Giant and Strong (the
	  damage each adds: enchant4, 3, 2, 7, 6, 5 in PlayerStats.txt) - the best
	  in hand goes on the hit. Monstrous, Giant and Strong are learned from the
	  card ("+175 to 1 spell") the first time one's in hand.
	- Turn on Options > Gameplay Options > "2D Combat Display" in Wizard101,
	  that's what shows the enemy nameplates.
	- The health numbers (the enemies' and your own) are read by the vision
	  helper by their digits' shape - the cut pictures in ui1.144\platedigits
	  (one of each digit and "/", cut at 1440p; they read other sizes too) -
	  and only when that can't read them for sure by Windows' OCR, which misses
	  the red numbers more often than not at 1440p. debug.log: "own health:
	  couldn't read it for sure (by shape: <why>)".
	- Needs Windows 10 or 11 (it uses the OCR built into Windows).
	- Open PlayerStats.txt and set your damage %, and the damage of the hit
	  spells in your deck. The numbers in there are only guesses.
	- When you set the boss with Alt+1, click the boss's nameplate at the top
	  of the screen. That way the program knows which enemy your traps and
	  feints are on. In a boss fight the kill check stays off until it can
	  find the boss's nameplate.
	- Statistic mode (Alt+S) shows a box beside the game window with the
	  health it read and the damage it thinks each hit will do, handy for
	  checking your settings. It needs room beside the window (it's never
	  drawn over the game); Windows+2 in developer mode shows the same info.
	- It plays it safe rather than wasting a hit: it assumes no crits, adds a
	  safety margin, only counts blades the program put on your own wizard,
	  only counts traps if you set solotraps to 1 in PlayerStats.txt (only do
	  that if you fight alone) - and then only on the enemy they went on
	  (the boss you picked, else the one with the most health) -, and never
	  counts bubbles (anyone's global replaces yours).
	- It's switched off in Dual mode, since both windows share what's been
	  cast and it can't tell what has landed yet.

Blades and traps by damage school (v0.50.0):
A hit can do damage of more than one school - Hydra hits with fire, ice and
storm heads. With the game's memory (navmem:1, read-only, as the cards
above) the bot knows each hit's heads and what each blade and trap in hand
boosts, and plays them by that:
	- The hit it boosts for (the planned hit) is the one that would deal the
	  most this round with the blades and traps in hand and those already on,
	  against the enemies left: an all-enemies hit counts on each enemy (no
	  more than its health), a one-enemy hit on one. hit4 only on a boss you
	  picked (Alt+1), only a hit you can pay for now (or the one pips are saved
	  for), and the kill check's own hit when it kills now. That hit is also
	  the one cast first when it's time to hit.
	- It looks for the blades and traps of every school the planned hit and
	  the other hits in hand need - not just your own school's: a Balance
	  wizard's Hydra gets the Elemental Blade, Balanceblade, and a pet's
	  Stormblade (storm head only). Balanceblade, Bladestorm, Hex and Feint
	  boost every school. On a hit of two or more schools it puts up the one
	  that adds the most first: Elemental Blade (all three heads) before
	  Balanceblade, before a Storm Blade (one head).
	- The kill check counts each head with only the blades, traps and aura
	  that fit it; an enchant on a hit of several heads is counted once, on the
	  head where it adds the least (the safe side).
	- A hit uses up only the boosts that fit its heads: a Power Nova leaves an
	  Elemental Blade on for the next Hydra.
	- The same blade from different places stacks: a deck Stormblade and a
	  pet's (or a treasure card's) both go on before one hit, and both count.
	- A pet's or gear's card (an item card) is never sharpened, made potent or
	  enchanted - the game doesn't allow it. The wand's own card is never
	  enchanted either.
	- The wand's free hit waits while it would use up a blade or trap meant
	  for the planned hit.
	- A blade picture that matches but isn't in the game's hand is a false
	  match: not used (debug.log says so once).
	- In a party battle the hitter tells its supports its planned hit's
	  schools: a Balance blader puts its pet's Stormblade on a Storm hitter, or
	  on a Balance hitter planning Hydra. A blader's blade that fits neither
	  the hitter's planned hit nor the blader's own school is thrown away -
	  only once the hitter has said which schools it plans for and is sure of
	  them (never a treasure card, never one you said never to discard). A
	  blade that doesn't fit the hitter's last hit, or that went on after it,
	  stays counted as on it.
	- New blades and traps learned from the game go in the slot their schools
	  say (resources\elementalblade, storm\blade, resources\blade3...).
	- A blade or trap the game has in hand that no picture finds (its slot
	  picture missing, an 8x8 placeholder, or one that matches only some
	  copies) is still played: the bot clicks it where it is - the card's box
	  in the hand, laid on the game's cards left to right - with the same
	  rules (a Sharpen / Potent, never on a pet's card, each copy once).
	  Only when that's sure: the hand settled, as many boxes as cards, no box
	  whose picture says another kind of card than the game has there, and
	  the card's own box not known as another card. debug.log: "boosts
	  searched for ...: blade3 (no picture)", "blade3: no picture found it -
	  the game's Balanceblade is card 2 of 6 in hand: cast at its box ...",
	  or "... not cast: <why>".
	- A copy that already carries a Sharpen or Potent (only the game's hand
	  finds one) never gets a second: a plain copy is sharpened first; that
	  one's cast as it is and counted with the enchantment it carries.
	- When the blade (or trap) kept for a Hydra can't be cast after all (its
	  box can't be sure), the one held back for it goes instead the same
	  round - even one before it in the battle's order (a pet's Stormblade).
	- A slot picture that doesn't find the game's card on two looks running
	  (the same box, two different looks at the hand) is replaced by the
	  card's own picture (the old one kept in backups\), so the pictures
	  work again, the game's memory read or not - never by a learned card
	  the game hasn't named so (or the learner is still checking), and
	  never over the slot's own card's picture. When the slot already has
	  the card's own picture, debug.log says why it still misses.
	- The pictures for your UI size: the set cut at that size (within 1%)
	  comes first, then the sets cut bigger (smallest first - shrinking keeps
	  detail), then the smaller ones (vision.py Library.masters). Till now a
	  set up to 3% smaller came first: at 1440p (UI 1.144) Balanceblade,
	  Locust Swarm and Helping Hands were looked for with ui1.121's pictures
	  enlarged 2%, and about half the Balanceblades weren't found.
	- Traps (Hex, Feint, Elemental and school traps - those that fit the
	  planned hit's schools, one a round) go on the boss you pick with Alt+1;
	  as a party battle's blader or healer, on the enemy the hitter goes
	  for; else - every battle (you asked, 2026-10-24) - on the enemy with
	  the most health, read off the plates as the kill check reads them. A
	  tie, or health that can't be read: where your planned hit goes (the
	  leftmost of them). debug.log: "trap3 on enemy 2 of 3 (3100/3100
	  health - the most) ...". The kill check counts them only on the enemy
	  they went on, and only with solotraps:1 ("I fight alone (count my
	  traps)" in Settings) - found again each round by its plate and its
	  most health; a trap on another enemy starts the count afresh, and one
	  whose enemy is gone goes with it.
	- Without the game's memory (navmem:0, an older helper, no helper) it
	  plays as before, by the pictures and PlayerStats.txt. Hits of more than
	  one school can then be typed in PlayerStats.txt, one line a head:
	  balance.hit3fire:230, balance.hit3ice:230, balance.hit3storm:230, with
	  balance.hit3 their sum (690) - heads that don't add up to it aren't
	  used. The card learner writes them for a learned hit.
	  Another school's blade or trap counts at blade.<school> / trap.<school>
	  (e.g. blade.storm:35 - storm.blade is your Storm wizard's own), else at
	  blade / trap.
	- debug.log: "plan: ...", "boosts searched for ...", "used up by ...;
	  still on: ...", "wand not cast: ...", and the hits' heads after "your
	  hits now:".

Stats reader (any window size, any wizard):
The kill check needs your wizard's Damage and Armor Piercing for the school it
hits with. They're read off the Spellbook's stats pages (it presses C, which
opens the book at the character page, reads Damage, Accuracy, Critical, Block
and Armor Piercing for that school, and closes the book) and kept in
PlayerStats.txt as <school>.damage, <school>.pierce, ... - one set per
school, with <school>.charid saying which character they're from. The plain
damage / pierce lines near the top are only used for a school with none.
	- AutoFarmer does it by itself: when it fights with a wizard whose
	  school has no stats yet, or whose stats are from another character of
	  that school, it reads them at the next quiet moment out of battle -
	  with Wizard101 in front and your hands off the mouse and keyboard for
	  5 s (it stops at once if you touch them, if the game loses focus or a
	  battle starts). At most once every 30 minutes per character.
	  debug.log: "Stats: ...". It knows each character's school from the
	  badge by its name plate in battle (resources\characters.txt) - and
	  when a battle shows no badge it knows (your plate in another slot can
	  show none), it goes by that: the school this character fought as
	  before, with your own plate (found by your name) as the hitter's.
	  debug.log: "no school badge found on the name plates - ..."
	- Tray menu "Read wizard stats now" (or double-click StatsReader.ahk;
	  while AutoFarmer runs, that just asks AutoFarmer to do it): read them
	  again, e.g. after changing gear.
	- StatsReader.ahk on its own (AutoFarmer not running): works out the UI
	  size and which character is logged in by itself; for a character
	  AutoFarmer has never seen fight, it takes the school with clearly the
	  highest damage. School at the top of StatsReader.ahk forces one.
Numbers are read with digit pictures resized to the UI size, checked with
Windows OCR; one that can't be read for sure keeps its old value, so it never
writes a wrong number (StatsReader.log / debug.log list every reading, and
pictures of the two pages go to %TEMP%\Wizard101 bot rounds\stats_*.bmp).

New cards (CardLearn.ahk - needs the Python vision helper):
Every round the bot reads the hand card by card. Only a box that looks like a
card is used (the edge between its picture and its text, the yellow pip digit,
no big white patch, a type icon the helper knows): the deck's back ("Cards 6 of
13"), the round's timer, the floor or a popup over the hand are never learned
or discarded (vision\vision.log lists each box it turned down, and why). A
card it has no picture for, shown in colour (a greyed-out one - not enough
pips - waits until it's castable), is learned:
	- its type from the icon at the bottom right of its picture
	  (ui1.144\cardicons: damage = hits one enemy, aoe = hits all, heal,
	  ward = a shield or a trap, charm = a blade, manip), its pip cost from
	  the yellow digit (ui1.144\carddigits and vision\digits - a digit read
	  is trusted over the pips you had), its kind and numbers from its text
	  (OCR at three sizes, two must agree: "65-105" -> 65; a misread range
	  like "805-345" is put right when only one fix makes sense)
	- kinds it knows: a hit on one enemy or all (with a part over time:
	  only the part up front counts), a heal, a shield (-50%), a trap (+N%
	  with the shield icon), a blade (+N% with the charm icon), an aura
	  (+N% to all spells, or your school's, for some rounds) - and kinds it
	  doesn't play: damage over time only, stun, dispel, prism (convert),
	  "Clear", X-pip spells, weaknesses. Those are kept and recognised, never
	  cast; one it can't be sure of is kept as "unsure" till it's seen at a
	  size where it reads
	- it's saved as <picture set>\learned\<id>.card.png (the whole card, for
	  you to look at) and .png (the picture the bot looks for)
	- it goes into a free slot (one whose picture was never cut), so the
	  battle code uses it like the hand-cut cards: a hit -> <school>\hit1-3,
	  only where they stay weakest to strongest (the battle casts hit3 first;
	  hit4 only for one stronger than all, as hit4 is only cast on bosses), no
	  pips -> wand, heal -> heal1/heal2, shield -> resources\tower, a trap ->
	  resources\trap3 (only "+N% to next spell" at the % PlayerStats.txt has
	  for trap3), an aura -> <school>\aura (only at its aura %), a blade as
	  before (blade3, or your school's blade, at their %). Its numbers
	  go into PlayerStats.txt (<school>.hitN, hitNpips, hitNtarget, ...) under
	  "Cards the bot learned by itself". The damage is read at three sizes
	  and two must agree (and make sense, low-high); if not it's written as 0,
	  so the kill check never counts on it - fix the number by hand then.
	- cards are learned per school (each wizard's own), shields for all
	- seen at another UI size, a learned card is cut again at that size
	- no free slot or an unknown type: it's only kept and recognised from then
	  on (and tried for a slot again whenever it's in hand)
From the game's memory (vision\handmem.py, the helper's /cards - read-only
like the walker's: nothing in the game is ever written, no key or click):
in a battle's planning phase, once the cards on screen are exactly your
hand, the bot has each card's real name, school, kind, pips (X pips too),
numbers (a hit's least damage, every head added; a heal; a %), whether it's
a treasure or item card and its enchantment - and your pips of each kind.
When there are as many as the helper's card boxes, card 1 (from the left) is
box 1 and so on: a new card is learned with all that - no OCR, nothing
guessed (Sure 100%, "read from the game"; flags mem, game=<its name>) - its
picture still cut as above; a card it knows by its picture gets the game's
name (if you gave it none), kind, number and pips put right, but never what
you set yourself on the Spells tab. An enchanted card it doesn't know by its
picture waits till it shows up plain. Your pips each round are the game's
count then (generic 1, power and your school's pips 2, another school's 1),
the pip row under your name still read each round, for the log and in case the game can't be read (debug.log:
"pips=N (from the game; the pip row read M)" when they differ). navmem:0 in
PlayerStats.txt switches it off with the walker's memory reading.
Copies of a card shimmer a little, so a learned picture is cut solid from one
copy and the pixels that differ in the next copies turn see-through by
themselves. A pip cost that couldn't be read is guessed as the pips you had
(the card was castable), and brought down whenever it shows up castable with
fewer - a pip digit read off the card is never changed that way.
learned\cards.txt lists everything learned (with its name, if you gave it
one, and its flags: tc = a treasure card, user = set by you, hold = never
discarded...); debug.log: "learned a new card ...".
Put right by itself, once a run, as soon as the vision helper is up and the
bot is out of battle (nothing is ever deleted - it's moved to backups\):
	- every learned card not checked yet is checked like a card in hand; one
	  that isn't a card (the deck's back, the timer, an empty spot - older
	  versions learned some) is moved out of the list, pictures and line, to
	  backups\learned junk\. Its pips are put right from the digit too.
	- a copy of a learned card's picture in a slot that isn't its own is
	  taken out of that slot (what was there before put back, else the copy
	  moved to backups\learned strays\), with that slot's lines in
	  PlayerStats.txt.
Stronger hits (Settings: "Make room for stronger learned hits", learnupgrade,
on): a learned hit 15% or more stronger than the weakest of hit1-3 takes its
place - out of battle only, never in a round. hit1-3 are then kept weakest to
strongest (the battle casts hit3 first), the cheapest one stays when the new
one costs more, and so does your only all-enemies hit when the new one hits
one enemy. Only slots whose damage and pips are in PlayerStats.txt are
moved; X-pip slots (hitNpips:0) and ones you pin with <school>.hitNkeep:1
stay where they are; a treasure card may take a free slot but never pushes
out a deck spell; the new card needs two OCR reads that agreed (or the
number you typed on the Spells tab) and its pips read off it. Before anything
moves, the three slots' pictures (every picture set's) and their
PlayerStats.txt lines are copied to backups\hits <school> <date-time> (<card
id>)\. Forget the new card on the Spells tab, or change its kind, and it's
all put back while the slots still hold what it left there and you haven't
changed their numbers since (otherwise just the new card comes out, and
debug.log names the backup folder). <school>.learnupgrade:0
switches it off for one school. Updates keep the pictures it moved.
Learned spells (the dashboard's Spells tab, or tray menu "Learned spells"):
every card the bot learned, with its kind, school, pips (3? = guessed),
number, how sure it is (Sure), where it's used (or why not), the text it
read, whether it's a treasure card, when and at what size it was learned.
Sure, out of 100%: its kind (40 - read alike twice or the same as its icon;
25 read once), its number (35 - read alike twice; 15 once; a kind with no
number gets all 35) and its pips (25 read off the card or X; 10 guessed).
Read from the game's memory: 100%. What you set yourself counts as sure;
what's still blank doesn't. Under the
picture: why. Sort by Sure (click its heading) to find the ones to check.
Pick one to see its picture. Pick one or more and:
	- Change kind...: what it really is. It's taken out of its slot (a hit
	  that made room for itself puts the hits it moved back) and gets the
	  slot the new kind fits, if one is free. "Not used" keeps it in the list
	  and out of use.
	- Edit...: its name, its number (a hit's least damage, a heal, the % of a
	  blade, trap, shield or aura) and its pips - e.g. a misread number. X
	  for the pips: an X-pip spell (all your pips; its number then its damage
	  a pip) - learned as one by itself when its text says "per pip".
	  Or in the list itself, as in a spreadsheet: double-click a Name, Pips
	  or Value cell and type over it - Tab keeps it and goes right (Shift+Tab
	  left), Enter down (Shift+Enter up); clicking away keeps it too, Esc
	  doesn't. Kind, School and TC are dropdowns: double-click (or Tab
	  onto) one and pick - a click keeps it, or arrows then Enter / Tab.
	  School: the card's own school - Fire, Ice, Storm, Myth, Life, Death,
	  Balance, or Sun (enchants), Star (auras), Moon (polymorphs), Shadow;
	  the card stays in the deck of the wizard it was learned for. TC: no
	  stops the bot taking it for a treasure card again. Kind has Polymorph
	  / shift (Moon), not played. Tab goes Name, Kind, School, Pips, Value,
	  TC. Other cells open the card's picture. A changed cell shows a * till
	  the bot has made the change.
	- Forget: out of the list, its pictures to backups\learned forgotten\. A
	  real card is learned again the next time it's in hand.
	- Never discard: it stays in hand even when the bot doesn't play it.
	- Show picture, Open folder, Moved away... (opens what's in backups\:
	  non-cards, forgotten spells, the hits moved to make room), Refresh.
	The bot makes these changes from its own loop as soon as it's out of
	battle (the status line says when some are waiting); what you set is
	never changed by the learner itself. debug.log: "Spells: ...".
Fleeing: only when completely out of cards - no card in hand (the deck used
up; a hand read where none of the boxes looked like a card doesn't count, and
the game's own hand is used when it can be read) for two rounds running. It
never flees for no hit in hand or for being out of mana (debug.log says so:
"... - not fleeing: only out of cards"). After fleeing it drinks a potion if
it's low on mana (none left: goes and buys some) and tries again.
PlayerStats.txt: fleeon:0 switches it off. debug.log: "fleeing: ...", "after
fleeing: ..."; the dashboard counts them next to Passed.
Learned hits in no slot: the bot casts by slot (hit1-4), and a treasure card
never gets one - so when no hit1-3 can go, it casts the strongest learned hit
in hand you can pay for (e.g. a Sandstorm treasure card), a target for a
one-enemy hit; one that doesn't go isn't tried again that battle till there
are more pips. Not thrown away while no hit1-3 can go. learnedhits:0 in
PlayerStats.txt switches it off.
Discarding in normal battles: every round, after it's read the hand, the bot
right-clicks away the cards it knows it never plays - learned cards of a kind
it doesn't play (stun, dispel, damage over time...) or one more card of a kind
whose slots are full - so the next round draws cards it can use; at most 3 a
round. Its own cards stay (also one it learned again at another UI size: where
the battle's own search finds one of its cards, nothing is discarded), and so
do cards it doesn't know yet and learned ones whose kind it couldn't tell. Spare blades and Sharpen go once they
can't stack any more, as before. PlayerStats.txt: discardunused:0 switches it
off, discardmax: how many a round. Learned treasure cards are never discarded
(that would use them up), nor spells set to Never discard on the Spells tab.
debug.log: "Discarded learned card ... - a kind the bot doesn't play: stun".
Learn every card (the dashboard's Cards tab, or the tray menu): for a deck you made
to be learned - one of every card. Switch it on and start a battle (an easy
one). Each round the bot learns what's in hand, right-clicks away every card
it knows so the next round draws new ones, keeps greyed-out cards it doesn't
know until there are pips to show them in colour, heals if your health is
low, and passes - it casts nothing else. It stops by itself when the deck is
used up (two rounds with an empty hand) or nothing new has come for three
rounds, and says how many it learned; then finish or flee that battle
yourself. debug.log: "learn every card: ...". The hand is read with the
mouse off it (a card under the mouse is drawn zoomed up); if you move the
mouse onto the hand meanwhile, no new card is learned that round.

Keys (the dashboard's Keys tab): every action that has a key - the bot on /
off (F6), walking (F8), the dashboard (Windows+2), restart (Windows+1, Alt+Esc),
quit (Windows+Esc), stop recording (F9), the battle picks (Alt+1 the boss,
Alt+2 who your boosts go to, Windows+3 your own plate) and the modes (Alt+E
loop, Alt+L lore, Alt+D dual, Alt+C command, Alt+S statistic, Alt+R response,
Windows+Alt+D developer) - with its key, its default and when it works. Pick
one and click Change (or double-click it), then press the new key, with Ctrl,
Alt, Shift or Windows if you like (8 s; Esc leaves it as it was). Its default
and No key (switched off - not for the bot on / off, quit or stop recording),
All to defaults.
Kept in dashboard.ini [hotkeys]. Not taken: keys the bot presses in the game
(W A S D, X, Space, Ctrl+O potions, Ctrl+1-9 Equipment Sets), Cheat Engine's
F13-F24, plain letters, digits and numpad keys (typed in chat), Alt+F4,
Windows' own (Windows+L, D, E, R, G, Tab), the developer's Alt+0 and
Windows+`, a key another action has, and the key a recording going on now
stops with.

Potions (Potions.ahk - needs the Python vision helper):
Out of battle the bot reads your health off the red globe. Under potionat %
(PlayerStats.txt, default 40) of your most health (read off your name plate in
battle) it drinks a potion (Ctrl+O). If health doesn't go up, you're out, and
it goes to buy more WITH GOLD (never Crowns):
	- By the zone's map (potionwalk:1, the default - the Settings window's
	  "Walk to the potion seller by the map"): nothing to record. The only
	  potion seller is Hilda Brewer in Wizard City's Commons (her spot is in
	  the game's own files). Out of potions anywhere else, the bot leaves a
	  Mark (Page Down) where it is, goes Home (the Home key - outside Wizard
	  City) and to the Commons (End), walks to her by the zone's map (the same
	  route planner as the quest walking), presses X at her prompt, clicks
	  Fill All (found by the words on it - never with "Crown" round it),
	  drinks one, Fills All again, and Recalls (Page Up) back to the Mark to
	  carry on. In the Commons already: no Mark, no Recall. Your house must be
	  in Wizard City (the Dorm is) - else it goes back and tells you. End
	  goes nowhere inside the Dorm, so it walks out its door to Ravenwood
	  first (the way out is in the game's files); End going nowhere there
	  too (it seems to take mana), it walks through Ravenwood's door to the
	  Commons. A Recall takes mana: one that doesn't work keeps the Mark
	  for the next run. With no
	  potions and none to be had it rests (no walking) till health is back.
	  A buying you recorded at your Mark (below) is still used; potionwalk:0
	  for only that.
	  debug.log: "Potions: walking to the potion seller (...) by the zone's
	  map", "Fill All at ...".
	Or recorded, at your Mark:
	- Once: leave a Mark (Page Down) right next to the potion seller
	  (Hilda Brewer, Wizard City's Commons) and keep it there - don't
	  Page Down anywhere else. Then tray menu "Record potion buying...": the
	  bot recalls you to the Mark (Page Up); press X to talk, click Fill All
	  (and close the window), press F9. It's saved as routes\mark_<wizard>.txt
	  with the name on the seller's "Press X" prompt. Each wizard has its own
	  Mark, so do this once for each.
	- When out of potions: Recall (Page Up) to the Mark (none if you're at the
	  seller already), and once her prompt shows the buying, drink,
	  then walking follows the quest arrow on from the seller. Mob-loop, lore
	  and afk farming can't get back to their spot yet - it tells you. Before
	  each click it reads the screen round it - any "Crown" stops the run. A
	  battle, you touching the mouse or keyboard, or a missing loading screen
	  stops it too. Nothing recorded yet: no recall, a tray message says how
	  to set it up. No Mark or too little mana for the Recall: a tray message,
	  another try in 10 minutes. The Mark somewhere else (another zone, or no
	  seller's prompt there): nothing clicked, no more recalls for that wizard
	  till you Mark by the seller again and restart the bot (Windows+1). Not right by the seller when recording?
	  Walk there and press Page Down: the recording starts over from there.
	- Tray menu "Buy potions now" does a run straight away.
	- potionmark:0 in PlayerStats.txt: the old way instead - the bot marks your
	  spot (Page Down), goes Home (End with potionfromhome:0: the Commons),
	  walks a route you recorded with the KEYBOARD only (routes\<zone>.txt -
	  use the mount you'll farm with, a route is a timing) and recalls back.
Mark & Recall: since Nov 2024 they cost 1-10 mana and recalling keeps the
mark. Some places (dorms, houses, some dungeons) can't be marked.

Quick sell when the backpack is full (QuickSell.ahk - Settings > THE BACKPACK,
quicksell, off till you tick it; needs the vision helper - the game's memory,
read-only, never a picture):
	- After a battle the bot played it looks at the game's memory: the
	  backpack's count against its size, and Prospector Zeke's alert in the
	  right-hand column (the same portrait also means "the gold bag is nearly
	  full" - then you're only told). Full: B, the game's own N/M read (it has
	  to say full), Quick Sell, each gear group (hats, robes, shoes, weapons,
	  athames, amulets, rings, decks) and - "...pets too", on - the Pet group
	  with ALL, No to "include Crowns Items?", SELL, the confirmation's numbers
	  read (no Crown items, furniture, jewels, reagents or treasure cards), SELL,
	  then the backpack's count checked. Gold over the pouch is lost (logged).
	- Never in a dungeon run, a dungeon being recorded, a zone the bot
	  entered through a sigil or a zone it leads on to. A dungeon you walked
	  into yourself isn't known as one: switch quick sell off before you start
	  the bot in it. After a dungeon the next full backpack is held - you're
	  told, so you can look through the good gear first - until 10 items have
	  gone from it, you ask from the tray, or you tick "...even with a dungeon's
	  drops in it". A group an Equipment Set's item is in (the boss deck's deck)
	  is left out, and set items are checked after: one gone turns it off.
	  Lock what you want to keep - the game never quick sells locked items.
	- Every click is a window the game's memory names, shown, its size as in
	  the game's files, on a short list; no key or mouse of yours since it
	  began, no battle, no "Crown" read round it. A Crown box other than that
	  No, or anything it doesn't know, stops it (it closes its windows or
	  leaves them to you); you touching the mouse or keys stops it at once.
	- Tray menu: "Quick sell the backpack now" (whether full or not) and "Quick
	  sell rehearsal (stops at the confirmation)" - everything up to the
	  confirmation, read and logged, closed, nothing sold (quicksell:2 in
	  PlayerStats.txt rehearses after battles, at most once an hour).
	  A group with Crown-shop gear ("Crown-..." or "Crowns-..." items) in the
	  backpack is left out - bank it to have that group sold (a full
	  backpack's alert names those groups and items).
	  quicksellfree:N sells with N slots or fewer left. debug.log:
	  "Backpack: ..."; the dashboard: Quick sells.

Along side simply playing the game this program has certain modes
all of which include, command mode, response mode, dual mode and lore mode.
Just as a note, all of these can be turned off be re-inputing the
same key combo.

At any moment you can close the program with "Windows+Escape"

Dual mode:
Pressing the key combo Alt+D will activate this mode. When activated,
at the end of each round the program will tab out as to switch to another
instance of wizard101. Dual mode is only to be used when you're playing on
two accounts. For better consistency close everything but the two instances
of Wizard101.

Command mode:
This mode allows the use of commands from other players, especially used
for teleporting. To activate, use the key combo "Alt+C". When activated
all commands are available to other players. The phrases are as shown.
	Port: 
		When sent to the player running the program, it'll teleport to
		the playing calling.
	Afk: 
		When sent to the player running the program, it goes 
		into a "Timeout prevention sequence" which basically means it
		makes the player move so that you wont disconnect from timeout.
	Enter:
		When sent to the player running the program, 
		it'll press "X" and it's used for interacting with things, and 
		entering sigils.
	Walk:
		When sent to the player running the program, it walks
		the recipient exactly two seconds forward.
		
LoreMode:
When activated, this mode will proceed to farm lore infinitely
so long as the player has mana and or potions. The main way of getting back
to the sigil is by logging out and in, so don't get scared when it does so.
Every cycle, the program waits exactly 30 seconds for the player to regain health.
		
Response mode:
what this mode does is respond to the player issuing the command before 
initiating the command itself. I Primarily made it for shits and giggles but
it does have its uses. For instance, when a command cannot be achieved for 
whatever reason, response mode will report an error instead of it's 
normal phrase.
