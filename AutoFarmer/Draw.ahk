; Draw.ahk - treasure cards drawn for an enchant that makes the kill. AHK v1.1, functions only; #Included by
; Autofarmer.ahk.
;
; The kill check (Autofarmer.ahk) found no hit in hand that ends the battle now, but one would with an enchant on it
; (+drawneed damage - PlayerStats.txt, 100 = Strong's, so any enchant does) and there's no enchant in hand: with
; drawenchant on (the Settings window, off unless you switch it on) the bot draws from your treasure-card deck - the
; DRAW button between Pass and Flee - until an enchant comes. Draw is greyed out with 7 cards in hand (the game refills
; the hand every round), so one card is right-clicked away first: never a treasure card (that would use it up), never
; the hit that makes the kill, nor an enchant; one that isn't a hit before one that is. A treasure card it doesn't
; know yet is learned on the spot (a Monstrous: CardLearn.ahk's "enchant" kind). The kill check then runs again with
; the enchant in hand - lethal: the hit goes enchanted; not: the enchant's kept for later and the round goes on as
; usual. At most drawround draws a round and drawmax a battle; Draw greyed out with room in hand (no treasure cards
; left) or a click that brings no card: no more this battle. Never with "Crown" read near the button, nor while you
; play. debug.log: "draw: ...".
