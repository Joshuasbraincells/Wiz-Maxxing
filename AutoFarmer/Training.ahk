; Training.ahk - TODO goal 4, card quests and spell learning (the AutoHotkey side): the spells your wizard knows watched,
; and the hooks where taking spell quests, spending training points at the trainers and putting new spells in the deck
; plug in once their windows have been seen in the game.
; AutoHotkey v2, written for v2 (v1 never had this: nothing here is ported); #Included by Autofarmer.ahk only.
;
; BUILT - READ ONLY (nothing is clicked, typed or sent to the game; nothing is spent): out of battle, the bot on, about
; every 10 minutes (Autofarmer.ahk's main loop, next to QsTick: TrainBookTick) the vision helper is asked for the
; spellbook - /book?fresh=1&ob=1, vision\deckmem.py book_lines: every spell the wizard knows, from the game's memory - and
; it's compared with learned\spellbook_<wizard>.txt (the wizard: its global id from the game's memory, /book's books|
; line - QuickSell.ahk's character key -, else the game's log's CharID). A spell that wasn't there is a NEW SPELL:
;   "Spells: new spell Thunder Snake (Storm, 1 pip, damage) [tid 1001]"
; in debug.log, once, and it's added to the file. The first look at a wizard only writes its file (nothing is new then);
; more than TrainBurst new at once are taken as known, quietly (one line: a misread, or another wizard's file).
;
; Settings (PlayerStats.txt, the Settings window's NEW SPELLS AND SPELL QUESTS - all three off by default, and none of
; their flows is built: each needs window names nobody has seen yet):
;   deckadd      new spells put in the deck - NOT BUILT (TrainDeckAdd's TODO). On: a new spell is also announced - a
;                tray tip and the Discord alert ("add it to a deck yourself") - and queued for the deck step
;                (TrainNewQueue). Off: the debug.log line only
;   trainspells  training points spent at the trainers by the plan (trainplans.txt, vision\spellplan.py) - NOT BUILT
;                (TrainRun's TODO): on, it's said once a run in debug.log, nothing else
;   spellquests  spell quests taken and done - NOT BUILT (TrainQuestTick's TODO): on, said once a run, nothing else
; With all three off the bot does exactly what it did before, but for the new-spell line and the file. With the spellbook
; not to be had (navmem:0, no helper or an older one, dual mode, a battle) nothing at all changes: said on the dashboard.
; Gold only, never Crowns: training points are never bought (the Crown Shop sells them), and no flow here may click a

;or button that opens it, the spellbook grid's entries, the school tabs, the page arrows, the deck's own cards; how an
;entry maps to a template id - its texture or tooltip), and that a click adds a copy and a click on a deck card takes one
;out (checked after each click with /deck's signature - vision\deckmem.py signature). Then Decks.ahk DeckLearnGame
