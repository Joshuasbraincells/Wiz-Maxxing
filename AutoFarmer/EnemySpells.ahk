; EnemySpells.ahk - what each enemy will likely cast this round, and defending first when their hits could kill the

;
; Who's fighting and what each cast: the game's own log (Bin\WizardClient.log - read only, the file Reconnect.ahk reads
; too, RcLog). Each planning phase names every slot ("CombatPlanningP Subcircle 1", then "MINION
; CombatantDataControlSmall, name:Ahnic Strider" - slots 0-3 the enemies, 4-7 your side), and each round each caster's
; spell ("CombatResolver::ResolveCombatRound. Duel ID:.. Round:3 Caster:1 Spell:Dark Sprite" - None: it passed); a new
; "Duel N: MSG_CombatPhase(...)" number is a new battle. Each enemy cast is counted for its creature (the vision helper's
; /enemyseen - wiki\casts.json), so the odds sharpen with every battle.
;
; The odds (the helper's /enemies - vision\enemies.py): each creature's spells off the Fandom wiki, its pips estimated by
; the round, the casts so far. Each round: logged ("  enemy spells: ...") and shown on the dashboard (WHAT IT SEES:
; Threat). Defending (EnemyDefend): when the chance this round's enemy hits kill the wizard is defendat % or more and no
; hit in hand kills them all (the kill check runs first) - a heal, else Tower Shield, before anything else.
