; Decks.ahk - decks (v0.47.0, TODO goal 3, asked 2026-10-23/24): a "small" deck for weak collect mobs, a "large" one for
; bosses, and as many more as you like. Each is a set of settings that override yours while it's the deck in use - how
; it plays (card logic, blades, traps, healing, pips, discards, which hits and heals it plays) - with what it's used for
; (anything else, collect goals, bosses, dungeon runs, farming), the school it's for, and the game's Equipment Set
; (Ctrl+1..9) that puts its in-game deck on. The bot picks one before each fight from what's ahead (DeckPick) and presses
; that set's key out of battle (DeckEquip). No decks - or decks that set nothing - and it plays exactly as without.
; A boss is known before the fight from the game's memory (2026-10-25, "it doesn't change decks for the bosses" - Alt+1 only
; names it inside the battle, too late for the in-game deck): the zone's mobs' titles, ranks and health (the helper's
; /mobs, READ-ONLY - vision\bossmem.py) - a boss the quest's goal names, the walker goes to or the dungeon run's way leads
; to is "a boss ahead" (DeckBossLook), and the boss deck goes on before the fight (an Elite only when it takes 3 or more
; of your best hits); in the battle its enemies from the memory (/battle) - the boss deck's settings without Alt+1 (a
; boss ahead held: while its in-game deck is the one on). One only passed by isn't: the walker routes round it, and one
; walked into is found in the battle.
; One file per deck: decks\<id>.txt - yours (updates keep them). The dashboard's Cards tab shows and edits them
; (Dashboard.ahk). AutoHotkey v2 (ported from v1.1), #Included by Autofarmer.ahk.
; Decks learned from the game (v0.8.0, TODO goal 3, 2026-10-30): every in-game deck in an Equipment Set read from the
; game's memory (the helper's /decks - READ-ONLY, vision\deckmem.py) becomes a deck here - linked to it by its id (game|
; in the file), its Equipment Set, school and the settings its cards call for (no blades in it: blades off...; boost or
; hit first; for bosses or anything else - vision\battlesim.py learn_decks); a setting you set yourself is never changed
; (the learned ones are listed: learned| in the file). The Cards tab's "From game" button, and by itself every 30 minutes
; out of battle (DeckLearnTick). And "can this deck beat it": a boss ahead is fought in the battle simulator (the helper's
; /sim - vision\battlesim.py: the linked in-game deck's real cards, your stats, the boss's health from the game's memory,
; its resists from the battles recorded and its spells from the wiki) with each deck for bosses - logged, and the one
; most likely to win it picked (DeckBetter).

;The decks ([{id, file, name, school, eqset, when: {default, collect, boss, dungeon, farm}, priority, vals: {key: value}}]),
;the one in use ("" none - your Settings as they are) and why, read again soon (an edit on the tab), when an Equipment Set
