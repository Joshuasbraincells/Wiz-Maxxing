; or no hit in a hand of fewer than 7 cards (a full hand's 7: the deck's used up, and heals and blades can't end
; the battle), or with less mana than the cheapest hit costs (every spell costs a mana a pip; a wand costs none,
; so not while one's in hand) and the bot can only pass for the rest of the battle: it clicks Flee (the word FLEE found by OCR
