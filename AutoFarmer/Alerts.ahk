#Warn Unreachable, Off
; Alerts.ahk - Discord alerts when the wizard needs you, through a webhook of your Discord channel. AHK v1.1, functions
; and labels only; #Included by Autofarmer.ahk.
;
; Sent for: the walker's "needs you" notices (stuck, a teleport that doesn't work, no quest arrow, waiting at the
; quest goal, a collect quest), out of potions with none to be had, "Crowns" seen in a potion run or a quick sell, out of
; mana, a wizard whose school the bot doesn't know, the backpack full and not quick sold (inventory - held for a dungeon's
; drops, quick sell failing, an Equipment Set's item sold), the gold bag nearly full (gold - Prospector Zeke's alert), and
; not getting back into the game (a login turned
; down, patching, the launcher, a ban or another login). The message says what's wrong, the zone and the time -
; nothing else: never a login, never a screenshot.
;
; The webhook's address is kept in Windows Credential Manager as "Wiz-Maxxing Discord webhook" - never in a file,
; never in debug.log (tray menu "Discord alerts...": set it - a test message is sent - or type OFF to remove it).
; alertson:0 in PlayerStats.txt (the Settings window) switches the alerts off. The same alert at most once in 10
; minutes; alerts less than 20 s apart wait their turn (held, then sent - never dropped); sent in the background
; (the bot doesn't wait for Discord) and the answer logged ("Discord: ...").

;When each kind was last sent (kind -> tick; "" -> any); the sends still under way ({req, kind, at}); alerts held
;for the 20 s gap ({kind, title, text}); tests only: another address for every send
