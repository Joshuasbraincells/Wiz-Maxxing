"""bossmem - READ-ONLY reader of the zone's mobs' TITLE (Boss / Elite / Normal / Easy / Minion), RANK, starting (max)
HEALTH and SCHOOL in a running Wizard101 client (WizardGraphicalClient.exe), and in a battle of every participant's health,
max health, boss flag and level - for picking the boss deck BEFORE the fight (Alt+1 only names the boss inside the battle,
too late: the game can't change the in-game deck mid-battle). navmem.py makes one per game (in a thread, like the hand's
and the quest's readers) for the vision helper's /mobs (each mob's title, rank, health, school, boss flag) and /battle.

    bm = BossMem(st, log=print)        # st: navmem's attached game (navmem._Attached); about half a second, once per game
    info, why = bm.mob(obj)            # a mob's ClientObject (navmem's objects thread) -> {title, boss, rank, health, ...}
    parts, why = bm.battle(hm)         # in a battle (hm: handmem.HandMem): [{owner, me, team, health, max_health, boss...}]

    mobs, why = navmem.NavMem().mobs()     # the zone's mobs with title, rank, health, school, boss, kind (navmem's way)
    parts, why = navmem.NavMem().battle()  # the battle's participants, each joined to its mob (name, title, rank)

    python bossmem.py [-n 1] [-i 2] [--battle SECONDS] [--duel] [--duels [SECONDS]] [--json]    readings from the command line

SAFETY. The game is opened by navmem.py's Proc - PROCESS_VM_READ | PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION (falling back to
PROCESS_VM_READ | PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION) and nothing else - and only read: ReadProcessMemory, plus
VirtualQueryEx / QueryWorkingSetEx and the module / toolhelp enumeration navmem.py uses. Nothing is ever written,
allocated, injected, hooked, suspended or debugged; no window is touched and no input is sent. Every class and property
offset is found by NAME in a copy of the game's code (its reflection registration: handmem.Image / questmem.class_props);
every object is checked by its vtable before it's used.

FAILS SOFT. mob() and battle() never raise: (None, why) when it can't be read; a value that can't be read for sure is
None, never a guess. The constructor raises LookupError when a reflected class or property isn't in this build (navmem
answers (None, why) then, and tries again after a while).

WHAT IS READ (build 6A9721E9-370E000, 2026-10-25 - every offset found by name each attach; the numbers are what they were):

  mob      the mob's ClientObject (navmem's objects thread: its vtable, global id and zone checked at each read)
             CoreObject.m_inactiveBehaviors (+0xE0): std::vector<SharedPointer<BehaviorInstance>> (16 bytes each)
             -> the NPCBehavior: the element whose vtable is one of NPCBehavior's (its GetType's - the type namer can't
                name it: its name is loaded too far into GetType)
             BehaviorInstance +0x48 its object (== the mob: checked), +0x58 its template - not reflected: checked (the
                object / the NPCBehaviorTemplate vtable) at each read, looked for in another build, kept once 2 mobs agree
             -> NPCBehaviorTemplate (CoreTemplate's m_behaviors list keeps no copy - its slot is empty client-side):
                m_nStartingHealth +0x78 (int), m_HideCurrentHP +0x7C (bool), m_nLevel +0x80 (the RANK), m_bossMob +0x90
                (bool: the same flag a battle's CombatParticipant.m_bossMob carries), m_mobTitle +0x94 (enum),

  titles   m_mobTitle's options, decoded from NPCBehaviorTemplate's registration code: each option's code ends with a LEA
             of a copy of "m_mobTitle"; its name is the string just before that copy in .rdata ("Easy", "Elite", "Boss",
             "Minion") or, pooled elsewhere, the string its code loads ("Normal"); its value the store to the one stack

             0) x75, (Boss, 1) x2: a Boss title always came with the boss flag)
  battle   the GUI's CombatantDataControl windows ("CombatantControl", one per participant: under handmem's root) -> the

             m_isPlayer, m_teamID, m_primaryMagicSchoolID, m_playerHealth, m_maxPlayerHealth, m_HideCurrentHP, m_bossMob,
             m_mobLevel (the level its stats are figured at - 40 for a rank 9 boss against a level-40 wizard: not the
             rank), m_isMonster, m_isMinion, m_minionStartingHealth
