"""navroute - the wizard's route through its zone, round walls and along the floor, for the walker (vision.py
/nav?route=1) and the dashboard's map.

READ-ONLY: it works from the zone's own files (navgeo: the floor, water and obstacles in collision.bcd) and the
readings /nav already makes of the game's memory (navmem) - nothing in the game is touched, no keys are sent.

    p = Planner(log=print)
    res = p.route(r)       # r: a navmem reading made with path=True
    # res: {'aim': (x, y), 'left': units, 'route': [(x, y), ...], 'why': ''} - or {'why': '...'} with no aim

How it plans
  * Where to: the game's own quest path (navmem 'path': nodes of the zone's nav graph, 480 apart) leads to the
    goal (navmem 'goal': the quest goal, or the way out of the zone when it's in another one). The planner
    heads for the farthest point of [path..., goal] within REACH of the wizard - the "carrot" - in a window
    round the wizard, the carrot and the path between them, in CELL squares. The carrot it has stays while
    it's still ahead and no more than KEEP further than that (a way round a wall can lead away from it for a
    while); it stops short of where the path comes back over (or under) an earlier stretch on another storey.
  * The height the wizard walks at there: the wizard's own height where it stands, the game's path's further
    on (its nodes can float above the floor in a few zones: they're moved by however far the nearest one is
    off the wizard's feet), in between along the path. In each square the floor is the walkable surface nearest
    that height - a walkable mesh, a walkable box's top, or the top of an obstacle box (many ramps, stair slabs
    and hillsides are boxes, walked on) - within FLOOR_BAND of it, so the storeys above and below don't count.
    A square with none is "no floor": a gap, a drop, a cliff's face - not walked or looked across (unless the
    window has no floor at all: then the files miss it, and it's walked as floor); water costs COST_WATER.
  * Obstacles - boxes and cylinders (by their real top and bottom in each square, sampled 3 x 3 times: many
    boxes are tilted, and logs and pipes lie on their sides), spheres, collision meshes - block a square when
    they reach into the wizard's body standing on its floor (from STEP_UP to HEAD above it). An obstacle box
    whose top is the floor of a square (no floor mesh under it) but stands more than STEP_EDGE above the floor
    beside it - a desk, a counter, a low wall - is solid there too. They're grown by CLEAR (forbidden) and are dearer up to SOFT
    away (so it keeps to the middle of a corridor when there's room). Two neighbouring squares whose floors are
    more than STEP_EDGE apart aren't walked between (a ledge, a cliff).
  * The cost to the carrot from every square of the window (a "field") is worked out in a background thread,
    ~30-200 ms, and kept: from wherever the wizard is in the window, the route is a walk downhill on it (a
    millisecond or two). A new field is worked out when the carrot moves on, the wizard nears the window's edge
    or climbs / drops far, or the goal changes; the old one is used meanwhile.
  * The aim: the farthest point along the route within LOOK_FAR that can be seen in a straight line keeping
    CLEAR_SEE from walls (else within LOOK_NEAR keeping CLEAR) - the walker steers at it.
  * left: the route's length to the carrot plus the game's path on from there to the goal - how far is left to
    walk, for the walker's "is it getting anywhere" checks (going round a wall gets no closer as the crow flies).

Things the zone files don't have - NPCs, other players, doors that open - aren't avoided; the walker's own
"stuck: back up and go round" handles those as before.

Mobs (the game's memory: navmem's mobs, those the caller wants avoided - not the ones the quest is about)
  * Each square within MOB_NEAR of a mob (on the wizard's storey) costs MOB_COST more, and up to MOB_SOFT away
    less and less more: the route goes round them where there's room. Not a wall: with no other way it's still
    a route. The field is worked out again when a mob near it has moved MOB_MOVED, or turned MOB_TURNED (at most
    every MOB_REPLAN s).
  * A mob notices you in front of it (its sight): the squares in a cone cone[0] degrees wide and cone[1] long in
    front of it - 180 wide: a semi-circle (the callers' shape setting; a circle all round is mob_near alone, no cone)
    - cost MOB_COST more as well, a little wider and longer less and less more - behind a wall from it too (whether
    a mob sees through walls isn't known; the collision grid has fences, posts and the like): the route keeps out of
    it where there's room. Its facing unknown (off the game's memory): the whole circle cone[1] round it.
  * The route on (MOB_AHEAD of it) still coming nearer a mob (on the wizard's storey) than the wizard is now, to
    within MOB_NEAR, or into its cone (the wizard not in it now; not where a wall hides him from it - no wait for
    that): the answer says so ('mob': the seconds it's waited, 'mob_at', 'mob_name') - the walker stands still till
    it moves off. A mob behind the wizard, or whose ring the route leads out of, doesn't count. One wait
    however the mobs take turns blocking: after MOB_GIVEUP s those mobs aren't avoided for MOB_IGNORE s (walked
    past - one may come for the wizard) - only their cone, when only their cone was in the way (their ring kept).
  * The wizard inside a mob's ring or sight now (a mob that walked up, the wizard come out of a battle or a
    loading screen there): no wait there - standing still in it is the worst. Out of it ('escape': the mob's
    name): along the route when that leads out without coming nearer it or into another's reach; else the aim is
    a way out - straight, never nearer the mob nor into any ring or another's sight, to a spot clear of every ring
    and sight - of those about as short as the shortest, the one with the least way left to the goal (the
    quest's way); none: as far out as such a line gets. Once out, the waits above as before - the time spent
    getting out counted in the wait. No way out at all: the waits as before.
  * A mob walking (MobMotion: its readings over the last MOTION_FIT s - a straight line fitted to them - at least
    MOVE_MIN units a second and two squares on; the caller's 'vel' with 'moving'): its ring and sight are swept along
    its way - where it will be over the next MOTION_AHEAD_S s, no further than MOTION_AHEAD_U, facing as it does (its
    facing unknown: the way it walks) - dearer less and less further on (MOTION_FADE), the dearest of them in each
    square; nothing is swept behind it, so the cheap way past is behind it. A field that has it walking is worked out
    again only when it leaves the line it was walking along by MOB_MOVED, turns MOTION_TURN, stops, starts or changes
    speed by MOTION_SPEED - or half its sweep's time is up - not every MOB_MOVED it walks. The wait checks (the route
    on, the arrow's straight line in blind) look at each point against where the mob will be when the wizard gets
    there (his own speed - MobMotion's - else WIZ_SPEED; no further than its sweep): one walking off the route doesn't
    hold him, one walking onto it does, before its sight touches the route now. A mob read standing still, or not
    read often enough to say: as it stands - exactly as before.
  * A line of mobs: a gap narrower than PASS_GAP between two mobs' rings or sight (or their sweeps) is closed - its
    squares cost MOB_COST as well (the line is one wall), and the window takes in the whole line (its mobs on the
    wizard's storey within each other's reach and PASS_GAP: a group) so the way round its end can be found - unless
    that would make it wider than MAX_CELLS (logged: as before, through the gap). The route on still going through
    such a gap is a mob on the way ('wall': the nearest of them) - the same wait, given up after MOB_GIVEUP: then only
    the gaps by those mobs are let go of (their rings and sight kept) for MOB_IGNORE s. PASS_GAP 0: no walls.
  * Other players' battles (duels: the caller's - the game's memory's duel circles with players in them, behind the
    duelavoid setting): a circle DUEL_R round each costs DUEL_COST a square, dearer up to DUEL_SOFT further, so the
    route goes round it where there's room (walking in joins the battle); the window takes it in like a line of mobs.
    Still on the route on (no way round): the answer says so ('duel': the seconds waited, 'duel_at') - the walker
    stands still; after DUEL_GIVEUP s (a battle takes minutes) it's walked past - no longer waited for, for
    DUEL_IGNORE s, still kept off where there's room.

Teleports
  * The zone's nav graph has links that aren't walked: a trolley, a portal, a hole down to the sewers - a link
    far longer than walking ones (JUMP_LEN), or between heights far apart and steeper than stairs (JUMP_DZ,
    JUMP_SLOPE) - unless the zone's map has floor all along it, with no ledge (and, a long one, nothing solid on
    the way): a long straight corridor is walked. The game's quest path takes
    them, even one this character can't use (locked till a quest's done) - and even one the wrong way: the
    zone's nav graph has most teleports one way only (a way out of the sewers isn't a way in), the game's quest
    helper doesn't mind which way a link goes. One taken the wrong way is routed round straight away (by the
    nav graph's links, which way they go). The carrot never goes past one: it
    stops at the link's start, and while the wizard is right there (JUMP_NEAR) the answer says so ('jump': the
    seconds it's waited) - the walker walks on into it, X at its prompt. If it hasn't taken the wizard after
    JUMP_GIVEUP seconds there, it's given up (BLOCK_FOR) and the route goes by the zone's nav graph round it -
    another teleport, or a way walked; with none, no route ('locked') and the walker says so.
