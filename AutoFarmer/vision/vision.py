"""Vision helper for AutoFarmer: finds cards in the hand and school badges on name plates.

AutoFarmer (AutoHotkey) starts this with pythonw and asks it over HTTP on 127.0.0.1. Instead of
ImageSearch's "found or not at this tolerance", every picture is matched at every position with a
distance (the RMS colour difference over the picture's solid pixels, see-through magenta left out), so
the best match wins and a threshold tells a real match from a near miss.

Pictures come from the same picture sets as AutoFarmer's (the main set at UI scale 1 and the ui<scale>
folders; see PicScale.ahk): each is resized from the cut set nearest above the UI size in use (a solid
<name>.raw.png next to a cut picture gives the colours to resize; the cut picture's magenta gives what to
leave out).
