                                    # long each took); --motion: the mobs watched walking (navroute.MobMotion)

SAFETY. The game is opened with PROCESS_VM_READ | PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION (falling back to
PROCESS_VM_READ | PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION) and nothing else. The only process APIs used are
CreateToolhelp32Snapshot / Process32*W (finding the pid), OpenProcess, ReadProcessMemory, VirtualQueryEx and
QueryWorkingSetEx (which of its memory is in use and in RAM - for the mobs; only that is read, nothing is paged
in), EnumProcessModulesEx, GetModuleBaseNameW,
QueryFullProcessImageNameW and GetExitCodeProcess. Nothing is
ever written, allocated, injected, hooked, suspended or debugged; no window is touched and no input is
sent. Signatures are looked for in a copy of the game's code read with ReadProcessMemory.

FAILS SOFT. Nothing here raises into the caller: every read gives (None, why) when it can't be done, and a
value that can't be read for sure is None (never a guess). Values the game's threads write are read twice
and kept only when two reads in a row agree.

WHAT IS READ (offsets of the client of 2026-10-13; when the helper attaches to a game, each is found again
by a signature in its code, or checked by a type name / window name it carries):

  player:  [exe + rva] GameClient*                          sig ZONE (also gives the zone offsets),

                 ClientObject +0xA8 x, y, z, +0xB4 pitch, roll, yaw: its own copy, used while it has
                   no body (zoning)
           The camera's object is checked to be a ClientObject by its type name (...ClientObject): a destroyed one's
           reads as PropertyClass (its destructor leaves the base class's vtable) and isn't followed - logged out or
           disconnected, the old world stays in memory a while.
           Z is up; yaw is measured from -Y: forward = (-sin yaw, -cos yaw).

           mobs:    every ClientObject of the zone holds the zone's ClientZone (GameClient +0x21368) at +0x130:
             the game's heap (its committed private read-write memory) is looked through for that pointer by a
             background thread - all of it (the pages in RAM) every OBJ_SETTLE_EVERY s for OBJ_SETTLE s in a new zone (its
             mobs come after the loading screen) and while none is found, then every OBJ_FULL s, in between only
             where objects were found, every OBJ_QUICK s (it stops when nobody has asked for OBJ_IDLE s - a long
             battle - keeping what it found: each is checked again at every read, and it carries on from there).
             ClientObject +0 vtable (a live one's type name ends ClientObject: a destroyed one's is its base class's,
             PropertyClass), +0x48 global id, +0x58 template, +0xA8 x, y, z (its own copy - the body's,
             as the wizard's, when it has one); template +0x60 its name (m_objectName), +0xA8 its display name's key
             (m_displayName), +0x1C8 its school (WizGameObjectTemplate's m_primarySchoolName - read on a Wiz* template
             only). A mob: a display name in one of the game's *Mobs name tables (Root.wad Locale/en-US/
             WizardMobs.lang, Mobs.lang) that has a name - wisps and the like have none - and a school (a teleporter
             can borrow a mob's name). Every other object with a name key is a thing (items()): an item (WizItems -
             Piece Of Coral), an object (WizQst371C7_00000008 - the Inactive Protector a USAGE goal names by that very
             key), an NPC, an ambient one (a mob's name, no school); its name from placements.py's name tables (read in
             its worker, kept). An object with no name key whose template's name is a door, a gate, a collision wall
             (puzzlefile.is_blocker: DynaTrigger_KT_DoorCollision, CL-StormLordTempleGate) is a blocker (blockers()):
             the walker held in front of one may have a puzzle to open it - and it going from memory is the way
             opening (the same template name and position reads as the mobs': no other offset) - each one's state read
             at every blockers() (statemem.py: its ObjectStateBehavior's current state, by reflected names - not
             confirmed in the game yet; None while not known; its reader made once per game in a thread like the
             titles'). An object with no name key whose template is one the zone's triggers' use events may be fired by
             (puzzlefile.use_templates - a lever the game names nowhere, matched by the event's words: "PedestalUsed",
             CL-Pedestal-01) is a thing of kind "use" (items(): name and key ""). An object is re-checked
             at each read
             - the same vtable (a destroyed one's is changed by its destructor), global id and zone - before its
             position is used.
           no place: a goal the game shows no way to (no arrow - "Use Inactive Protector in District of the Stars
             (0 of 3)") reads the thread's goal exactly (0, 0, 0), hops 0, the HUD's distance -1, hops 0: noplace 1
             (noplace_of), how long it has held for the goal timed by every read() (NoPlaceHold)
           titles:  each mob's title (Boss / Elite / Normal / Easy / Minion), rank, starting (max) health, school and the
             game's own boss flag: its NPCBehavior's NPCBehaviorTemplate - bossmem.py, its offsets found by name in the
             game's reflection registration (handmem.py's way), read under this lock once per mob object (kept while it
             lives: a mob's template doesn't change; one that couldn't be read tried again after BOSS_RETRY s); its
             reader made once per game in a thread like the hand's. In a battle (battle()): the battle GUI's participants
             (their health, max health, boss flag, team), each joined to its mob by its owner's global id
           goal:    the goal line (txtGoalName under the QuestHelperHud, its ids at +0x2D8 / +0x2E0) and the quest
             manager's quest data (WizQuestData -> WizGoalData -> its madlibs) - questmem.py, its offsets found by name
             in the game's reflection registration (handmem.py's way), read under this lock, the names looked up outside
             it; its reader made once per game in a thread like the hand's
           The quest thread (it updates every 100 ms) keeps its own zone name: after a zone change its goal
           belongs to the old zone until it catches up, so goal, target, distance and path count only while
           the thread's zone is the game's zone (and target / distance only while the arrow's hops are the
           thread's). The HUD and the thread are rebuilt on a character switch, so the chain is walked
           again on every read.
