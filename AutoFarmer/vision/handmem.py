"""handmem - READ-ONLY reader of the spell cards in the wizard's hand during a battle, and the wizard's own pips, in a
running Wizard101 client (WizardGraphicalClient.exe), for the vision helper's /cards.

    hm = HandMem(st, log=print)     # st: navmem's attached game (navmem._Attached) or a LightAttach; ~0.5 s once
    r = hm.read()                   # a dict (see HandMem.read) - never raises
    print(answer(r, ""))            # the lines /cards answers
    p = hm.phase()                  # the round's phase alone, cheaply (no spell read - see HandMem.phase): /phase

    r, why = navmem.NavMem().cards()   # the same through navmem's own attached game, under its lock (vision.py's way)

    python handmem.py [-n 3] [-i 2] [--json]        readings from the command line (and how long each took)
    python handmem.py --phase -n 100 -i 0.1          the round's phase alone, 10 a second (what the hand does as a
                                                     card's clicked, its target clicked, the round played)

SAFETY. The game is opened by navmem.py's Proc - PROCESS_VM_READ | PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION (falling back to
PROCESS_VM_READ | PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION) and nothing else - and only read: ReadProcessMemory, plus
VirtualQueryEx / QueryWorkingSetEx and the module / toolhelp enumeration navmem.py uses to find it. Nothing is ever
written, allocated, injected, hooked, suspended or debugged; no window is touched (not even asked about - only the
command line looks at which one is in front, to pick the game) and no input is sent. Every offset is found by NAME in
a copy of the game's code read with ReadProcessMemory (its own reflection registration), or checked by a type name /
window name the object carries before it's used.

FAILS SOFT. HandMem.read() never raises: whatever goes wrong comes back as why (a card that can't be read: its own
why, the others still read), and 'ms' and 'planning' are always set. A value that can't be read for sure is None,
never a guess. The hand is only "settled" - the cards to play - when the cards on screen are exactly the wizard's
own hand list (see read); while the game is dealing, discarding or laying the cards out it says 'hand changing'
(callers ask again every 100 ms, up to 1.5 s). The constructor raises (LookupError: a reflected class or property
isn't in this build) - NavMem.cards() catches that and answers (None, why).

WHAT IS READ (offsets of the client of 2026-10-13, build HAND_BUILD; each is found again by name or checked by type
or window name - in another build a place that fails is looked for, and kept once a second card window agrees):

  GUI      [exe + WizardGUIManager static] (navmem's GUIMGR_HUD candidates, checked by the HUD's window name
             "windowHUD") -> the root window: the pointer in the manager whose children hold the HUD (+0x118 now)
             -> its children (Window.m_Children: a vector of SharedPointer<Window>, 16 bytes each) down to the window
                of type CombatPlanningPhaseWindow -> SpellSelectionWindow -> the window named "Hand"
             -> its SpellCheckBox children "Card1".."Card7" and "PetCard": on screen left to right by their left
                edge (Window.m_Window.left - Card1 is the rightmost; windows are reused as cards come and go, so a
                name is no place)
             shown: Window.m_Flags bit 0 - on the planning window: the planning phase; on a card: it's on screen (a
                discarded / not yet dealt card's window is hidden, its old spell still in it; out of a battle the
                windows read shown with no spell at all - so nothing is read from them out of a battle)
             box (v1.0.0, NOT CHECKED against the screen yet): a card's place in the root - its m_Window (in the Hand
                window's units) plus the left / top of every window on the way down from the root (the root's own left
                / top not added: bossmem.combatant_windows' rule for the plates) - in GUI units, the root's rect beside
                it (the client: 1827 x 1027 at 2560x1440). Whether a zoomed card (the mouse on it) or the hand sliding
                back to the middle after a card leaves changes m_Window isn't known: AutoFarmer's KillCalc.ahk
                MemBoxCheck compares these boxes with the ones /hand sees on the screen, log only, before any is clicked
             the card's spell: the pointer in the SpellCheckBox whose type is GraphicalSpell (+0x450 now)
  me       the pointer in the SpellSelection window whose type is ClientCombatParticipant (+0x358 now) - alive only in a
