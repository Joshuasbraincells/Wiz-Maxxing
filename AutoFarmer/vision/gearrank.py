"""gearrank.py - the GEAR MODEL (TODO goal 5, "gear dungeons until all gear is swapped"): an item's equip effects as stats,
whether the wizard may wear it, how good the wizard's totals are for its battle role, the best swap a slot (the plan),
and a dungeon run's drop log with its "done" check. Pure Python (numpy not needed): it reads nothing from the game
itself - the vision helper hands it what gearmem.py read (vision.py /gear) - and writes only the drop log
(AutoFarmer\\learned\\drops\\, DropBook).

    stats, unknown, index = item_stats(item["effects"])   # gearmem's effects -> {"damage.fire": 12, "health": 300...}
    ok, why = meets_reqs(item["reqs"], level=120, school="fire")      # True / False / None (not known) and why
    s = score(totals, "hitter", "fire")                    # log-points: a +0.05 change is about 5 % better
    r = swap_plan(worn, bag, totals, school="fire", level=120, role="hitter", margin=2.0)
                                                           # {plan, judged, notes}: one best piece a slot, why
    book = DropBook(folder)                                # learned\\drops: <run>.txt (drops), <run>.state (an .ini)
    book.mark(run, reading, when)                          # the backpack's ids at a run's start
    out = book.run_end(run, reading, plan, slots, stopafter, when)   # this run's drops logged, dry runs, done?
                                                           # (marked=False: its start wasn't noted - not counted)

    python gearrank.py --demo                              # a made-up wizard and backpack through swap_plan

NOT CONFIRMED IN THE GAME YET. The names and meaning of the gear's reflected properties are the community's (wiztype /
wizwalker dumps): StatisticEffectInfo's stat name (m_effectName: "CanonicalFireDamage") and its number - which may be an
index into a table looked up by the item's level (m_lookupIndex: bossmem.py saw that on mobs - "its number isn't here")
rather than the value. A number read is taken as the value only from a property named like one (VALUE_PROPS); an index
is kept as one ("#3" on /gear) and the stat's size is then NOT KNOWN - never guessed: such an item is compared by its
level requirement instead (basis "level"), else not at all (verdict "unknown"). Every delta is ADVICE - Gear.ahk logs it,
equips nothing (gearswap is a rehearsal), and holds the quick sell while a backpack piece looks better.

THE SCORE (one number for the wizard's totals; a swap's delta = the new totals' score less the old - in log-points: x100
is about the % it's better). The totals are the wizard's own (PlayerStats.txt's school stats - the worn gear in them) with
the worn piece's stats taken off and the candidate's added. offence = the damage curve (battlesim.damage_multiplier) x
the hit chance (the school's own accuracy + accuracy, at most 100 %) x a critical's worth on average (crit_chance /
crit_mult against ENEMY_BLOCK) x what's left of ENEMY_RESIST after pierce; defence = health / (1 - resist) x incoming
healing; pips = 1 + half the power-pip chance + 0.1 a starting pip; healing = 1 + outgoing healing %. Each by its log, the
role's weights (ROLE_WEIGHTS - hitter, healer, blader; PlayerStats gearweight.off:1, gearweight.def:0.5... override), item cards
a small bonus each.
