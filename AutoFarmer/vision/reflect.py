"""reflect - READ-ONLY discovery tool: every reflected PROPERTY of a class in a running Wizard101 client (its offset, its
name, a guess at its C++ type) and the reflected NAMES that match a pattern (classes, properties - with the classes that
register them -, enum options) - the one tool for finding where a value lives before a reader is written for it: a
pet's (BasePetItemBehavior, PetItemBehaviorTemplate, PetLevelInfo), gear's (StatisticEffectInfo, WizItemTemplate,
RequirementList), the quests' and the wizard's (WizQuestData, WizGameStats - training points, the wizard's level), a
gate's (ObjectStateBehavior). Found the way every reader here finds its offsets: handmem.Image (a copy of the game's code)
and questmem.class_props (its own reflection registration) - nothing hard-coded.

    python reflect.py --class WizGameStats [--class BasePetItemBehavior,PetLevelInfo ...]
                                    every property of each class: offset, name, type guess, bytes to the next one
    python reflect.py --grep "rain|Training|Level"
                                    the reflected names matching (any case; --case: as written) - for a property the
                                    classes that register it and its offset there, for a class how many properties
                                    (--props: those too)
    python reflect.py --class X --grep Y --out reflect.txt      both, also written to a file - to send back
    [--pid N]                       that game client (else the one in front, else the first)

A class's OWN properties only: those it inherits are its base class's registration (WizClientObject's m_globalID is
CoreObject's) - --class that one too (a property's grep names every class registering it).

The answer, one line each (| between fields; a field never holds a | or a line break):
    # python reflect.py ... (when) - build <build>, pid <pid>
    class|<name>|<properties>|<GetType rva>|<vtables>|<first vtable rva>      (properties 0, the rest empty: not a
                                    reflected class in this build)
    prop|<class>|<offset>|<name>|<type guess>|<bytes to the next property>|<adder rva>    (by offset; type: the same
                                    property adder - AddProperty<T> - as a property whose type the readers here rely on
                                    (ANCHORS), "?" when none shares it; adder rva: properties of one type share it)
    grep|<names matching>|<listed>                      (the pattern: in the # line - a regex holds |)
    name|<name>|<kind>|<string rva>|<copies>|<what>     (kind: prop (m_...), class (a GetType with its Type and
                                    vtable), enum (kName, Scope::NAME), name (another identifier), other (with spaces,
                                    <>...); what: a property's "Class+0x1a4 Other+0x60" ("" none found), a class's
                                    "N properties")
    none|<why>

SAFETY. The game is opened as deckmem.py's command line opens it - navmem.py's _Attached (its read-only Proc:
PROCESS_VM_READ | PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION, falling back to PROCESS_VM_READ | PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION), else
handmem.py's LightAttach (the same Proc, without the walker's signatures) - and only read: ReadProcessMemory of the
game's PE header and .text / .rdata / .data (handmem.Image - .data is the game's writable statics, copied as they are),
what _Attached reads checking its signatures as it opens the game (each GameClient static it finds - 8 bytes - and 8
bytes of the GameClient that points at, 0x20000 in), plus the module / toolhelp enumeration navmem.py uses to find it.
Nothing is ever written, allocated, injected, hooked, suspended or debugged; no window is touched and no input is sent.
Apart from that GameClient check no object of the game is read - the classes come from its code and its sections' data,
no object is walked.

FAILS SOFT. A class that isn't in this build is said (class|X|0 and a none| line), never guessed; a name whose owner
can't be found has an empty what. The pure parts - grep_names, name_kind, name_at, owner_candidates, guess_types,
class_lines, name_lines - are tested on made-up bytes (test_reflect.py), report() on a made-up game image.
