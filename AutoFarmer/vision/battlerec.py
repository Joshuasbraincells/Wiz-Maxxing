"""battlerec.py - the battle recorder of the vision helper: every battle (the ones you play too) written down from the
game's own log and memory, so the bot can learn battles later (TODO goal 3, step 1).

    rec = battlerec.start(root=ROOT, nav=nav_reader, log=log, gate=GATE)      (vision.py main(), after placements)

WHERE IT COMES FROM
  * The game's log (Bin\\WizardClient.log): every caster's spell, its targets, damage, crits, wards / traps, hanging
    effects, health changes, passes, misses, deaths and the result. Tailed here (short opens 500 ms apart, read only -
    Python's open shares read and write: the game keeps writing). A line is used only when it matches one of the
    patterns below; raw lines are never kept (the log may hold chat).
  * The game's memory (read only, navmem's reader): the hand (template ids, enchantments, treasure / item cards), my pips,
    the enemies' rank, title, school, boss flag and max health, the deck. Mostly COPIED from answers the bot already got
    (the /cards and /battle hooks in vision.py - no new read), plus a few own reads only when the bot can't be reading:
    a round the bot doesn't play (bot off / you playing), a battle's first PrePlanning (the deck's signature, navmem's
    cached mob infos - no read) and out of battle (the deck).
  * The bot (AutoFarmer\\BattleRec.ahk): its round's DebugLog lines (the reasons, verbatim) posted once, fire-and-forget,
    after the round's last click (POST /rec?ev=round), and its state (hello / who).

NEVER SLOWS A ROUND. The request threads only put what they already have on a queue (microseconds). This thread does the
rest; while a gated request (a memory read the bot or walker waits on) is in flight it stops within 10 log lines and
sleeps until the request is over; it writes files and makes own reads only when nothing gated ran for 100 ms; it never
reads memory in a planning phase the bot plays. FAILS SOFT: every hook is wrapped (vision.py _rec_hook); an item that
can't be used is dropped and counted; an unexpected error in this thread is written to vision.log once and the recorder
switches itself off till the next hello - the helper and the bot go on as they were.

=====================================================================================================================
THE FORMAT (schema "wizmaxx-battles", version 1) - this docstring is its source of truth
=====================================================================================================================
Files (under AutoFarmer\\learned\\battles\\ - kept by updates, never sent anywhere):
  YYYY-MM\\YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl     the battles started that day (by t0); -2, -3 ... after a day file reached 32 MB
  YYYY-MM.jsonl.gz             months before the last two (each day file one gzip member; read back, then removed)
  cards.jsonl                  card facts by template id (the last line per tid wins)
  current.json                 the battle in progress (checkpoint after each round; tmp + os.replace)
  today.txt                    date|battles|won|lost|fled|bytes|last|why (one line; the dashboard's "recorded today")
  Over CAP_MB (1 GB): months gzipped (all but the current one); still over: recording pauses (today.txt why "paused:
  learned\\battles is full - move old months away"). Nothing is deleted but a .jsonl whose gzip copy was read back.

Lines: JSON Lines, UTF-8 (ASCII: non-ASCII as \\uXXXX), no BOM, "\\n" ends, one object a line, written in one os.write
(a leading "\\n" first when the file doesn't end with one: a torn line from a crash stays on its own line). Readers skip
a line that doesn't parse and a "rec" they don't know, and check "v" line by line.
  {"rec":"header","v":1,"format":"wizmaxx-battles","doc":"AutoFarmer\\\\vision\\\\battlerec.py","made":"...","bot":"v1.3.0"}
      the first line of every .jsonl
  {"rec":"battle",...}         one battle (below)
  {"rec":"card",...}           one spell template's facts (cards.jsonl)

Rules for every field: null = unknown / not read / not readable (each section's "why" or "src" says which); an absent
key = doesn't apply, or this version / phase doesn't write it; [] = read and empty; 0 / "" = a real "none"
(enchantment 0 = none). 64-bit ids (gids, the Duel ID) are decimal STRINGS; template ids (u32) and the log's short ids
are numbers. t* fields: local wall clock "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" from the log's own stamps (1 s). *_s fields: seconds (1
decimal) by GetTickCount64 ticks (the helper's; AHK's A_TickCount is the same clock). Health in HP. Effect params are
the game's integers (35 = 35 %). Stat floats the game's own (sDamage 29.999998 = +30 %). A new optional field keeps v;
a changed meaning or a removed field raises v.

A battle (rec "battle"):
  rec, v          "battle", 1
  id              "YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<duel>" - t0 + the duel number; unique

  duel_gid        the 64-bit Duel ID (ResolveCombatRound "Duel ID:", or HandleEnterCombat "combatGid:"), str - the
                  same in every party member's log: records of one battle on several PCs join by it; null none seen
