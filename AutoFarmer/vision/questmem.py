"""questmem - READ-ONLY reader of the quest's active goal in a running Wizard101 client (WizardGraphicalClient.exe): the
goal line as the game shows it under the quest arrow ("Defeat Crustacean Waverunner and Collect Foul Tasting Algae in The
Grotto (0 of 3)"), its kind, status and count, and the mob / item / NPC it names - for the vision helper's /goal, and the
line its /nav, /mobs and /items match the zone's mobs and items against (instead of the OCR of the screen, which slips
letters: 2026-10-24 "Opiio (jn -rhe" for "Defeat Optio Agenor ...", and the quest's own mob was kept away from).

    qm = QuestMem(st, log=print)        # st: navmem's attached game (navmem._Attached); about a second, once per game
    snap = qm.snapshot((quest, goal))   # the memory reads - under navmem's lock (the ids: the quest helper thread's,
                                        # navmem's quest / goalid, standing in for the HUD's own)
    g = qm.resolve(snap)                # the names looked up (Root.wad's name tables - outside the lock), the line built

    g, why = navmem.NavMem().goal()     # the same through navmem's own attached game and lock (vision.py's way)

    ids, why = qm.quest_ids()           # EVERY quest in the quest manager's map [(GID, WizQuestData)] - under the lock,
    raw = qm.quest_raw(qid, q)          # each one's keys, goals and properties - under the lock (one quest at a time),
    rows = qm.quests_resolve([raw...], tracked=qid)   # the names looked up - outside it (navmem.NavMem.quests, /quests)
    print("\n".join(quest_lines(rows)))   # one line a quest, one a goal

    python questmem.py [-n 3] [-i 2] [--all]     readings from the command line (and how long each took); --all: every
                                                 quest too, as /quests answers

SAFETY. The game is opened by navmem.py's Proc - PROCESS_VM_READ | PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION (falling back to
PROCESS_VM_READ | PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION) and nothing else - and only read: ReadProcessMemory, plus the module /
toolhelp enumeration navmem.py uses to find it. Nothing is ever written, allocated, injected, hooked, suspended or
debugged; no window is touched (not even asked about - only the command line picks the game in front) and no input is
sent. Every class and property offset is found by NAME in a copy of the game's code read with ReadProcessMemory (its own
reflection registration: handmem.py's Image / class_props); every object is checked by its type name or window name
before it's used; the three places that aren't reflected (the quest manager's map, a quest's goal map, the HUD's ids) are
found by their shape and checked by key == id at every read.

FAILS SOFT. snapshot() and resolve() never raise: whatever goes wrong comes back as why, and a value that can't be read
for sure is None ("" for a name) - never a guess. The constructor raises (LookupError: a reflected class or property
isn't in this build) - NavMem.goal() catches that and answers (None, why).

WHAT IS READ (build QUEST_BUILD, 2026-10-24 - the offsets are found by name each attach; the numbers are what they were):

  the line   [exe + WizardGUIManager static] (navmem's gm) +0x2D0 the HUD (window name "windowHUD") -> +0x6A8
             QuestHelperHud (navmem's hud_qhh, window name "QuestHelperHud") -> its children (Window.m_Children +0x70:
             a vector of SharedPointer<Window>, 16 bytes each), 6 levels at most, down to the window named
             "txtGoalName" (type ControlText; its sibling "txtDistance" holds the arrow's number) -> ControlText.m_sText
             +0x2C8 (std::wstring "<center>Defeat ... (0 of 3)</center>" - its markup taken out)
             on screen: bit 0 of Window.m_Flags (+0x9C) of it and of every window above it up to the HUD (a battle
             hides the ElementWindow - the text stays; a loading screen or a dialogue drawn over it still reads shown)
  its ids    QuestHelperHud +0x2D8 quest GID, +0x2E0 goal GID: the ones it sets txtGoalName from - ahead of the quest
             helper thread's +0xC88 / +0xC90 by up to a second at a goal change. Not reflected: checked at every read
             (the quest in the manager's map, the goal in its goals); in another build looked for in +0x200..+0x800.
             The thread's ids stand in when they fail; a goal reading COMPLETE is the quest moving on (the other ids'
             goal is taken when it isn't)
  the data   [exe + rva 0x3336E80] the quest manager (not reflected; in another build found by its shape: a .data
             pointer to an object holding the map below) +0x80 std::map<u64 quest GID, SharedPointer<WizQuestData>>
             (head, size; node +0 left, +8 parent, +0x10 right, +0x19 isnil, +0x20 key, +0x28 the object) - checked:
             the values are WizQuestData whose m_id is the key (+0x90 holds the same quests by another key)
             WizQuestData: m_id, m_title (QuestTitle_...); +0xB0 std::map<u64 goal GID, SharedPointer<WizGoalData>> (not
             a reflected property - m_goalList is an empty list: found by shape, the map whose values are WizGoalData
             with m_goalID = key, then kept); for /quests, EVERY other reflected property of its own whose type is one
             of KIND_REF's (int, unsigned int, bool, float, std::string, std::wstring, a gid - told by its property adder,
             as a madlib argument's) - none named here: what tells a spell quest apart isn't known yet, so all of them
             are read and shown (QUEST_PROPS_CAP at most, by offset)
             WizGoalData: m_goalID, m_name (WizardQuestGoals_Kill ...), m_status (GOAL_STATUS_*), m_type
             (GoalTemplate::GOAL_TYPE_*), m_location (ZoneLocName_...), m_madLibs -> MadlibBlock
             MadlibBlock.m_madlibs: std::list<SharedPointer<MadlibArg>> (head, size; node +0 next, +0x10 the arg)
             MadlibArg.m_madlibToken: NAME, LOCATION, TALLYTEXT (an item or object), TALLYTEXT2 (a mob), COUNT, TOTAL,
             FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME ...; MadlibArgT<T>.m_madlibArgument: T told by the property adder that the function in
             its vtable's slot 3 calls to register it - the same adder as a known property's of that type
             (std::string Window.m_sName, std::wstring ControlText.m_sText, int SpellEffect.m_numRounds ...)
             (the quest helper thread keeps a copy of the quests at +0xC70 - without the madlibs: not used)
  enums      m_status / m_type option names: each name string is loaded in WizGoalData's registration code and its
             value stored just after (mov dword [rbp-50h], imm32) - checked by known values, else numbers only
  names      "<Table>_<key>" -> Root.wad Locale/en-US/<Table>.lang (handmem.parse_lang), each table read once
  the line   the game's own sentence for the goal's kind (Quest.lang: BountyChat, BountyCollectChat, UsageChat,
             ScavengeChat, PersonaChatFL / F / L; else "NAME TALLYTEXT in LOCATION") - its #n: and $GOAL_PREFIX$ left
             out, the place the part after "|" ("Celestia|The Grotto") - then " (COUNT of TOTAL)" when TOTAL > 1: the
