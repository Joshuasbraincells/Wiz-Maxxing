; BattleRec.ahk - the battle recorder's AutoHotkey side (TODO goal 3, the first step of learned battle play): for each
; battle round the bot looks at, its own reasons - every debug.log line of the round, verbatim - and its state go to the
; vision helper once the round's clicks are over; the helper (vision\battlerec.py) joins them with the game's own log
; and memory into one record per battle in learned\battles\ (the record's format: vision\battlerec.py's docstring).
; AutoHotkey v2, written for v2 (v1 never had this: nothing here is ported); #Included by Autofarmer.ahk only. Its hooks
; there are one call each; in a function that isn't assume-global (DebugLog, PlayerActing, BotToggle) and in the other
; files (Settings.ahk CfgSaveNow, Dashboard.ahk DashRefresh) by V1IsFunc + .Call, so a test copying one of them without
; this file runs it as before.
;
; It never slows a round: nothing here waits for anything. A line is one push onto an array (BrecNote, from DebugLog);
; a round's post goes out when the battle loop's next look for a round starts - after the round's last click, the mouse
; already unlocked - and without waiting for an answer (WinHttp asynchronous: Open(.., true), Send; at most 4 in flight,
; one more is dropped, never retried); nothing here reads the game, its log or its memory, and nothing costly runs in a
; round (Settings saved in a round: its hello waits for the round's end). It never changes how the bot plays: it only
; copies what the bot already has - no global of the bot's is ever set - and every function is wrapped in try: an error
; is logged once and the recorder stops (BrecFail) - the battles are played on as ever.
; Nothing typed goes out: the settings are a fixed list of numbers (BrecSetKeys), your wizard's name is the game's (the
; log's - never party.ini's typed [party] name), a deck's typed name isn't sent, a line with "http", "webhook", "token",
; "password" or "login" in it is left out and the names typed for decks and the party are cut out of the lines.
;
; Setting (PlayerStats.txt, the Settings window's HOW IT PLAYS ITS CARDS): battlerec - on unless 0 (a missing key: on).
; Off: no buffer, no post at all (a helper told "on" earlier in the run is told "off" once).
;
; What goes to the helper: POST http://127.0.0.1:<VisionPort>/rec?ev=<event>..., Content-Type text/plain; charset=us-ascii,
; ASCII only. The body: key<TAB>value lines (each value BrecEsc'd); a round's then one  L<TAB><ms><TAB><line>  per line
; (ms since the round opened; the line BrecEsc'd: \ -> \\, tab -> \t, LF -> \n, CR dropped, anything outside
; printable ASCII -> \uXXXX - UTF-16 code units). A key the helper doesn't know is skipped by it.
