; Kill calculator for AutoFarmer.ahk (AHK v1.1), #Included at the end of Autofarmer.ahk.
; Reads enemy health off the 2D Combat Display nameplates with Windows OCR (Ocr.ahk), predicts
; the minimum (no crit) damage of each hit in hand from PlayerStats.txt plus the boosts we've cast,
; and picks the cheapest hit that kills every enemy. Whenever something can't be trusted it claims
; no kill, so the normal battle code plays the round instead.
; Uses the super-globals declared at the top of #1:: in Autofarmer.ahk: Stats, EnemyHP, BossSlot,
; BossMax, HealthStatus, AppliedBlades, BossTraps (the traps on one enemy: TrapSlot, TrapFoe*), AuraRounds, EnchantedHits,

;card's box (HandBoxes: UseBlade / UseTrap / UseMemAt / ClickBubble / UseNegAura / BoostSettleMem through BoostMemBox,
;BoostCopyPick), the slide after an enchant (MemSettle). One look out of line: not trusted at that size till three in a
