#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0
; StatsReader.ahk - reads your wizard's Damage, Accuracy, Critical, Block and Armor Piercing off the
; Spellbook's stats pages and writes them into PlayerStats.txt as <school>.damage, <school>.pierce, ...
; for that wizard's school (the kill check uses <school>.damage and <school>.pierce). Run it while
; you're NOT in a battle; it opens the Spellbook, turns to the two stats pages and closes it again.
;
; Works at any window size / UI size (the pictures and positions follow it, see PicScale.ahk), and works
; out which wizard is logged in: AutoFarmer notes each character's school (from its name plate in
; battle) in resources\characters.txt; for a character it hasn't seen, the school with clearly the
; highest damage is taken. Set School below to force one.
;
; While AutoFarmer is running, this asks AutoFarmer to do it instead (two scripts clicking at once
; would get in each other's way): it reads them at the next quiet moment out of battle. AutoFarmer also
; reads them by itself when it fights with a wizard whose school has no stats yet.
;
; A number is only written when it was read the same way twice (digit pictures and Windows OCR), so it
; never writes a wrong one; what it couldn't read for sure keeps its old value. What it read goes to
; StatsReader.log, and pictures of the two stats pages to %TEMP%\Wizard101 bot rounds\stats_*.bmp.
; (v1's #NoEnv: v2 always)
#SingleInstance force
; (v1's SetBatchLines -1: v2 always runs at full speed)
