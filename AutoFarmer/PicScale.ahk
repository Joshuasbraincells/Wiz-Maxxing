;needed, from the cut set nearest above that size (PicPath -> PicMake) into generated\ui<scale>\ as a
;.bmp. A made picture is never pixel-exact, so it's searched for with at least GenTol colour tolerance,
;and it's see-through magenta (*TransFF00FF) wherever the resizing isn't sure of the colour (PicOpt).
