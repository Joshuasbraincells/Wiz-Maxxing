; QuickSell.ahk - the backpack quick sold for gold when it's full (asked 2026-10-25: "when your backpack is full a circular
; alert icon with prospector zeke shows up on the right hand side of the screen ... we should have the bot look for that
; after a battle and if its there i'd like to to quick sell our entire inventory" - "of course this should be a setting
; to be turned on and off because dungeons would cause good gear to be sold"). AutoHotkey v2 (ported from v1.1), functions
; only; #Included by Autofarmer.ahk. Needs the vision helper and the game's memory (vision\bagmem.py - /bag and /gui,
; READ-ONLY): without them it does nothing (no picture is ever trusted for this - Zeke's portrait also means "the gold bag
; is nearly full").
;
; Settings > THE BACKPACK: quicksell (off by default), quicksellpets (pets too - on), quicksellafterdungeon (off). Hidden
; (PlayerStats.txt): quicksellfree:N - sell with N slots or fewer left (0); quicksell:2 - a REHEARSAL: everything up to the
; confirmation window, read, logged and closed - nothing sold (after battles at most once an hour). Tray menu: "Quick sell
; the backpack now" and "Quick sell rehearsal (stops at the confirmation)".
;
; When: after a battle the bot played (the main loop's spellbook block - QsBattleEnd, QsTick), three looks at the game's
; memory (0, 3 and 8 s after it): the backpack's count against its size (calibrated by the game's own "N/M"), and Zeke's
; icon in the HUD's right-hand column. Full - or Zeke's icon with the gold bag not near full - is a look: B, the game's
; own N/M read; full by it: the sale. Never in a dungeon run, a dungeon being recorded, a zone the walker entered through a
; sigil or a zone that one leads on to (QsZoneChange); after a dungeon the next full backpack is held (you're told) until
; you've sorted it, unless quicksellafterdungeon. A dungeon you walked into yourself isn't known as one.
;
; The sale - every click target from the game's memory (name and ancestors, shown, its rect, its size against the .gui
; file's, its label), on an allow-list, turned into pixels: B (the backpack page), Quick Sell, each gear group (Hat,
; Robe, Shoes, Weapon, Athame, Amulet, Ring, Deck) and the Pet group (quicksellpets) with ALL - never the All group (it
; takes housing and jewels too) - and No to "Would you like to include Crowns Items in the selected items?" (the one
; Crown box it may ever click, only No, only when its game key in the log, its caption, its button's label and an OCR
; of "No" agree), SELL, the confirmation's numbers read (Crown rows, furniture, jewels, reagents, treasure cards 0; no
; pets unless quicksellpets; its total its rows'), SELL, Yes to the pets box only when its count is the confirmation's,
; then the backpack's count falling checked. A group an Equipment Set's item in the backpack is in is left out (the boss
; deck's deck), and every such item is checked to be there after - one gone turns quick sell off. Before each click:
; no key or mouse of yours since the run began, the bot on, Wizard101 in front, no battle, no "Crown" read round it - and
; after the hover, none of yours still and the mouse still on it: the click goes AT the target, never where the mouse is.
; Anything else - a box it doesn't know, a timeout (60 s for the whole run) - backs out window by window (each close
; checked); a Crown box stops it with nothing clicked. A key of yours stops it at once - no more input -, and so does
; your mouse between its clicks: each move and hover, click and B holds your mouse off (Settings.ahk's mouse lock -
; mouselock, "quicksell"), and what it swallowed then isn't you (UserIdle: QsOk, QsClickAt).
