; Potions.ahk - out of battle: drinks a potion when your health is low, and when there are none left goes
; to buy more with gold (never Crowns): Recall to your Mark at the potion seller and the buying you
; recorded there once. AHK v1.1, functions only; #Included by Autofarmer.ahk. Needs the vision helper
; (Vision.ahk) to read the globes.
;
; Health: the number on the red globe (vision.py /globes, digit pictures in ui1.144\globedigits), as a %
; of your most health (read off your name plate in battle - <school>.maxhealth in PlayerStats.txt - or
; the most the globe has shown). Under potionat % (PlayerStats.txt, default 40) it drinks (Ctrl+O, the
; game's Drink Potion key); health not going up after that means no potion was left.
;
; Out of potions (potionmark:1, the default): your Mark is at the potion seller - you leave it there
; (Page Down, right next to Hilda Brewer) and the bot never marks anywhere else:
;   1. Recall (Page Up) to the Mark - a recall keeps the Mark, so it's there for the next run too (none
;      when you're at the seller already)
;   2. the buying recorded there (routes\mark_<wizard>.txt - each wizard has its own Mark, so its own
;      recording: X to talk, the Fill All click, closing it), once the seller's "Press X" prompt with the
;      name read when recording (HILDA BREWER) shows - else it's the wrong place and nothing is clicked
;   3. drink, then carry on from there: walking follows the quest arrow from the seller (the walker
;      starts afresh). Mob-loop, lore and afk farming have no way back to their spot yet - it tells you
; Nothing recorded for this wizard yet: no recall (it would only pull you off your quest) - it tells you
; how to set it up. No Mark or too little mana (Page Up does nothing): it tells you and tries again 10
; minutes later. A Recall in the Mark's own zone may come without a loading screen: the seller's prompt
; showing, or mana going down (the Recall's cost), counts as arrived. The Mark somewhere else (another zone, or no seller's prompt there): no more
; recalls for this wizard till the bot restarts or you record the buying again. A run that ends without health going up (no gold, a missed click) waits 10 minutes
; too. Page Down / Page Up / Home / End are never recorded or replayed (Page Down while recording at the
; Mark: your Mark moved there, so the recording starts over from there).
;
; potionmark:0 - a refill run along a route (routes\<zone>.txt) instead, which moves your Mark:
;   1. Mark Location (Page Down) where you are
;   2. Go Home (the Home key) - you always land in the same spot there, and it's the same house from any
;      world, so one route does for all (potionfromhome:0 in PlayerStats.txt: the world's Commons (End)
;      instead - but you land somewhere different there each time); the game's log says which zone it is
;   3. the route recorded from there: your keys (walking, X to talk) and left clicks (Hilda
;      Brewer's "Fill All" etc.), replayed with the same timing; loading screens on the way are waited for
;   4. drink (now there are potions), then Recall (Page Up) back to the mark
; Before every click it reads the screen round it: any "Crown" there stops the run (it buys with gold
; only). A battle, you touching the mouse or keyboard, or a loading screen that doesn't come stops it too.
; No route from there: it recalls back and tells you to record one.
;
; By the zone's map (potionwalk:1, the default) - nothing recorded: the potion seller's spot is in the game's own
; files (the vision helper reads it: Hilda Brewer in Wizard City's Commons - the only one). Out of potions:
;   1. a Mark (Page Down) where the wizard is, to come back to (not in the Commons itself, nor in your house)
;   2. outside Wizard City Home (the Home key - your house in Wizard City), then the Commons (End); in Wizard City
;      the Commons straight away. End (the game's GoHub) goes nowhere inside the house (the Dorm), nor with no
;      mana (it seems to take some, as a Recall does - Home doesn't): out through the house's door first (its way
;      out is in the zone's files - the Dorm's into Ravenwood), then End; End not taking: walked through the zone's
;      door to the Commons (Ravenwood's)
;   3. walked to her by the zone's map (the route planner, the game's memory - read-only), X at her prompt, Fill All
;      (found by the words on it, never with "Crown" round it), the window closed
;   4. one drunk, then Fill All again - full again
;   5. Recall (Page Up) to the Mark, and on from there (the quest arrow)
; A way that doesn't get to her (no Commons after End - your house in another world?): back to the Mark, and it
; tells you. A Recall takes mana (up to 10): one that didn't work keeps the Mark for the next run. A buying you recorded at your Mark is still used when there is one; anything that can't be done by
; the map falls back to the recorded ways below.
;
; Recording (tray menu "Record potion buying..."): the bot recalls you to your Mark (Page Up); press X to
; talk, click Fill All (and whatever closes the window), then press F9. You stay at the seller.
; potionmark:0: the bot marks your spot and takes you Home (or to the Commons); walk to the potion seller
; with the keyboard (W A S D / arrows - not the mouse, a camera turn isn't recorded), press X to talk,
; click Fill All (and whatever closes the window), then press F9. It saves the route for that start and
; recalls you back. Record on the same mount you'll farm with: a route is a timing.
