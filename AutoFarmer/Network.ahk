#Warn Unreachable, Off
; Network.ahk - the dashboard's Network tab (v0.46.0, asked 2026-10-24: a PC that runs the bot all day, watched and
; steered from another): every bot on your home network with Settings > Network on - its PC, version, wizard, zone,
; on / off, Play for me, what it's doing, health, mana, deaths - and, once you pick it, its recent log and its game's
; picture; buttons turn it on or off, switch its Play for me off or restart it (with the network PIN, the same on both
; PCs - Settings: netpin). Play for me can only be switched OFF from the network: on only at that PC (its button).
; The vision helper does the talking (vision\netmon.py): NetTick tells it this bot's state every 2 s and takes the
; others' and any commands for this one. Settings: neton (off till you switch it on - Windows then asks once to let
; Python through its firewall: allow it on Private networks), netport, netpin. AutoHotkey v1.1, #Included by
; Autofarmer.ahk.

;The bots heard ([{id, ip, age, pc, ver, wiz, school, zone, bot, pfm, doing, hp, mana, deaths, dall, up, status, last}]),
