; Puzzle.ahk - the way to the quest's goal blocked for good at one spot (a gate, a door that won't open - 2026-10-26 Storm
; Lord's Temple: its gate opens only once the two guards standing off to the sides are beaten): before telling you, the bot
; tries what usually opens one, looking after each try whether the way's open - the enemies standing off to the sides
; fought, things with a prompt nearby X'd, the zone's NPCs talked to. What you do to get past after a notice is recorded
; and saved in learned\puzzles.txt once the way opens or the goal moves on; the bot does it itself first the next time
; (any character, any PC with the file). A journal of what happened in the game lately (the game's own log, your X key)
; feeds both.
; AutoHotkey v2, written for v2 (v1 never had this: nothing here is ported); #Included by Autofarmer.ahk only - AutoQuester
; has none of it, so every call from the shared files (Walker.ahk, Vision.ahk, EnemySpells.ahk, Dungeons.ahk) asks
; V1IsFunc first.
;
; Reads only: the game's memory through the vision helper (/nav, /mobs, /items, /blockers - READ-ONLY: nothing in the game
; is ever written, injected or hooked), the zone's own files (/zonepuzzle, /navpass - files only) and the game's log
; (WizardClient.log, as EnemySpells.ahk reads it). Your X key is watched by a pass-through hotkey (the key still goes to
; the game; nothing else you type is looked at). No web page is ever fetched. Nothing with Crowns on it is ever X'd or
; clicked: a prompt is read right before each X, and one naming Crowns is never X'd.
;
; Settings (PlayerStats.txt, the Settings window's WALKING): puzzles (the tries - on unless 0), puzzlelearn (the recording
; and the replay - on unless 0). Files, all A_ScriptDir's: learned\puzzles.txt (the ways learned - kept by updates, yours
; to edit), resources\puzzles_known.txt (the seed that ships with the bot - replaced by updates; a learned entry for the
; same spot or goal wins), learned\puzzle_recording.txt (a recording under way - a restart carries on with it),
; generated\puzzle_journal.txt (the journal and a duel under way - a restart keeps them), generated\puzzle_hold.txt (the wait at
; a blocked way and the hour's tries - a restart keeps them).
