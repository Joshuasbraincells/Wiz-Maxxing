; Party.ahk - a party of up to 4 wizards, one per PC on the same home network (TODO goal 1, phase 1). AHK v1.1,
; functions and labels only; #Included by Autofarmer.ahk.
;
; Settings (PARTY): partyrole - Off, Leader (quests as now; waits while a follower is far, in another zone or not ready -
; partywaitdist, partywaitmax) or Follower (goes where the leader goes - partynear - instead of following its own quest
; arrow; into the leader's battles; through the door the leader took). The party's port: partyport. This wizard's party
; name and (a follower) the leader PC's address: the tray menu's Party... window (party.ini - not secret: a name, an
; address), with the role and the battle part too (the same settings as Settings > PARTY's).
;
; The vision helper does the talking (vision\party.py): every half second PartyTick tells it this bot's state (/party)
; and gets the party back - the leader's place, door and battle spot; the followers'; each one's battle part
; (partybattle), wizard's name, school and hits. State only: nothing one bot sends can make another press anything -
; a blader's or healer's boosts go to the party's hitter's plate, found on its own screen by the name the game's log
; gives for its own side. Phase 2 (teleport to friend across zones) isn't in yet: a follower whose leader went where it
; can't follow waits, and says so - "can't follow" (v0.9.0: the helper tells a door the leader walked through from a
; teleport - End, Home, a sigil, a potion run: it stood still before its zone changed; not checked in the game yet, so
; only acted on with Settings' partytpdoors on, else logged -, keeps its last 3 doors - a follower two zones behind
; walks door after door - and says when a teleport to the leader would be the way: its port_advice. A door that doesn't
; take the follower is given up after 3 tries - a try a battle cut short not counted, tried again 6 minutes on; one that
; can't follow tells the leader - tp -, which stops waiting for it. Where the Friends list's Teleport plugs in, once its
; windows are known: PartyCantFollow).
;
; Battle roles (phase 3 - Settings: partybattle): with more than one wizard on your side, a Blader puts its blades on the
; hitter (the wizard set to Hitter - the leader's first -, else the leader), its traps on the enemy the hitter goes for,
; casts them again after each of the hitter's hits, Tower Shield on it, and hits only for a kill or with nothing else to
; do; a Healer heals the one of you lowest under healat %, shields them, else boosts as a blader. Anything not sure (no
; party state, the hitter not on your side, its plate not read): this wizard hits, as ever.

;The party as last heard: the role, the helper's state (off/serving/following/unreachable/error) and why; this wizard
