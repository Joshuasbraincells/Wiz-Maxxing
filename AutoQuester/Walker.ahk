; Walker.ahk - walks the wizard towards the current quest goal by following the yellow quest arrow,
; one step per WalkStep() call. AHK v1.1, functions only. Shared by AutoQuester.ahk (walking only)
; and AutoFarmer\Autofarmer.ahk (battles and walking in one loop), so walking fixes go here.
;
; Needs, from the script that includes it: the super-globals GameLeft, GameTop, GameW, GameH (the
; game's client area, kept up to date by its UpdateGameRect()), GameExe and GameClass, and an
; #Include of ArrowReader.ahk. Call WalkerInit() once at start.
;
; In AutoFarmer the game's memory is a better source for the same decisions (NavRead in Vision.ahk: the
; vision helper reads where the wizard is and where the quest arrow points - READ-ONLY, navmem in
; PlayerStats.txt): its heading once it has agreed with the arrow's, its distance instead of the OCR'd
; number, steering on while scenery hides the arrow, and turns measured as they go. Whenever it can't be
; used the arrow on screen decides, as before. See "The game's memory" near the bottom.

;---- The game's memory: a better source for the same decisions ----
;
;In AutoFarmer, NavRead (Vision.ahk) asks the vision helper where the wizard is (x, y and its facing, yaw)
;and where the quest arrow points (the node on the game's own path it points at, the distance along that
;path, the zone changes to go), read straight out of the game's memory - READ-ONLY: nothing in the game is
;written, no keys or clicks (navmem:0 in PlayerStats.txt switches it off). The walker uses it for the
;decisions it makes anyway:
;  - heading: from the wizard's facing to where the arrow points (+ = right, like ReadArrow's). Which way
;    round the game's world is isn't known for sure, so it's only used once it's been checked: NavAgreeNeed
;    fair readings agree with the arrow on screen (mirror images and its sign is turned round), or a turn
;    went the way it said - then kept (resources\nav_calibration.txt, checked:1) and used from the start
;  - distance: the memory's / how it compares with the number printed on the arrow (worked out from fair
;    readings for each zone - it differs - kept in resources\nav_calibration.txt) - instead of the OCR'd
;    number, which misses lone digits
;  - no arrow on screen (scenery hides it, or a see-through arrow on a floor its own colour can't be picked
;    out): the memory stands in for it (WalkNavStandIn), not back up and turn to find it, or wait
;  - turns: until the wizard's facing has turned that far (NavTurn), not TurnRate's guess
;  - the goal in another zone (hops > 0): this is the way out - walk on into it, no X (StartTalk)
;Anything wrong with it (no answer, an ERR, the quest helper off, a zone that isn't the one in the game's log,
;nothing to steer at): the arrow on screen, at once - logged when it comes and goes ("the game's memory ...")

;This step's reading of the game's memory (see above). Sets WkNavOk (usable), WkNavH, WkNavD ("" until it's
;known how its distance compares with the arrow's), WkNavHops and WkNavUse (its heading is steered by).
